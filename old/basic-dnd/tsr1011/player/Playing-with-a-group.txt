====== Playing in a group ======

==== How to Prepare ====

D&D games are the most fun with 2-6 players plus one Dungeon Master. When you get a group together, each of you can pick one of the characters included in this booklet. All the different types are there, and each character is all ready to go, with Ability Scores, hit points, and Alignment. All you have to do is pick the one you want, think of a name, and select some equipment. \\ //ONE PERSON MUST BE THE DUNGEON MASTER.// \\ Whoever tat is, the person should read the DUNGEON MASTER'S RULEBOOK to see what is involved. This must be done before a group gets together to play. \\ Remember that everyone will be learning together during your first group gmaes. The DUNGEON MASTER'S RULEBOOK contains step-by-step instructions to help everyone learn, but have patience. A module (separately published adventure) should //not//  be used in your first games. The DM should use the dungeon in this set, which contains manu hours of entertainment and can be used for two or three games. The "B" series of modules may be used after that. \\ While you are using that adventure, the Dungeon Master should review the rules. The Additional rules may be added at some point, if desired. More adventures and dungeons may either be created by the DM or purchased from stores. Eventually your characters will reach 4th Level, and you will want to move on to the D&D EXPERT Set rules.

**Setting Up**

When your group gets together to play, everyone should bring what they need, including dice, pencils and paper, and characters (preferably on Character Sheets). Refreshments, if desiredm are often brought by everyone, as a game my go on for hours. \\ A table is normally used. The Dungeon Master sits at one end, with the secret information about the dungeon to be explored. The DM often uses an upright piece of stiff cardboard (called a "shield" or "screen"), to hide the description and maps of the dungeon so they are not accidentally seen by any of the players. \\ The players sit around the table, away from the DM, where they can all easily see any maps made during the adventure, the order of the figures (if used), and so forth. To avoid confusion, the table should be kept clear of other items. \\ During the game, players should be allowed to refer to the PLAYERS MANUAL whenever they wish. They should not be allowed to see the DUNGEON MASTER’S RULEBOOK during the game! The mystery and excitement of unknown monsters and magic can be spoiled if someone looks up the details during the game. \\ If you only have two or three players, the DM may allow the use of a few hired non-player characters, retainers. The rules for retainers are given in the DUNGEON MASTER’S RULEBOOK.

**Mapper and Caller**

Although each person will be playing the role of a character, the players should also handle the jobs of "Mapping" and "Calling." Any of the players can be the "Mapper" or "Caller," whatever their characters may be.

The **mapper**  is the player who draws a map of the dungeon as it’s explored. One or more of the characters should be making maps, but one of the players must make the actual game map. The map should be kept out on the table for all to see and refer to. Pencil should always be used in making the map, in case of errors and tricky passages. \\ Mapping is an important part of imagining where your characters are. Sooner or later, all players should learn to make maps. If you play often, take turns at mapping; it is an important and useful skill to learn.

The **caller**  is a player who announces to the Dungeon Master what the group of characters (the Party) is doing. The Caller must check with every player to find out what all the characters are doing, and then tell the DM (quickly and accurately) what they plan to do. The Caller does not tell the others what to do; the Caller merely reports what is going on. \\ The Caller’s first job is to find out the "party order" — the way the characters are lined up or grouped during normal travel. The Caller should also report the movements of the group, such as "We’ll go northeast through the woods," or "We’ll turn right at the next corridor." Battles are always more complicated, and the DM should then take the time to check with each player, instead of handling it all through the Caller. \\ You may have games without Callers, if the Dungeon Master is willing to ask each player what each character is doing, and make notes to remember the actions. But it’s usually easier and more organized if one player acts as Caller.

**First steps to take**

When all the players are together, with characters ready, each player should take a moment to think about the adventure to come. Some of these things apply to players, and some apply to the characters.

**Who**  is your character, and who are the other characters? Have you adventured with them before, or not? Are any of them friends - or enemies? Should you keep an eye on any one character? Who can you trust completely?

**Why**  are you going? Are the characters just out to explore, or is someone looking for a specific item? Are you out to rescue a prisoner, destroy a famous monster, or some other goal? Games are usually more fun if a specific goal is kept in mind; if nobody is sure just what they want to do, you can waste a lot of time doing nothing.

**Where**  are you going? Nearby caves, or a castle, or some other dungeon? Have you bought the equipment you need to explore?

**When**  are you going? Do you plan to explore a dungeon at night, when more dangerous creatures could be around? Players: decide when the game will end; it’s very easy to play longer than you intended. Set a time for quitting, and stick to it! Remember to leave some time for dividing the treasure found.

**What**  are you going to do? Look for big monsters or small ones? Will you run from danger, or face it? What can your party do, considering the abilities and special items available amongst the characters?

**Treasure**

Before the adventure begins, all the players should decide how the treasure will be divided after it is found. This is a very important decision, as characters earn more XP from treasure than from anything else. The method of division is left entirely to the players! \\ The most common method is described on page 55. You may use it if you wish, or you may make up your own. The method should be chosen before starting, to avoid arguments later.

**Marching Order**

You should arrange your characters in a line, either singly or two-by-two, for a "Standard Marching Order." If figures are used, the DM can easily see everyone’s position; otherwise, write the Marching Order on a piece of paper for the DM’s reference. \\ You should have at least one Fighter in front, as this is where most of the action takes place. A short person (halfling or dwarf) should also be in front of taller folk. Those behind may still see clearly, and are able to cast spells or shoot arrows over the shorter characters’ heads. \\ Weaker characters (Magic-Users and Thieves, especially) should be in the center of the Marching Order, protected front and rear by Fighters or Clerics. If this is not possible, the characters with the best Armor Class and/or Hit Points should occupy the outer positions. \\ If you change the Marching Order during the game (if a front Fighter is badly wounded, for example), be sure to correct the figure setup (or the DM’s diagram) accordingly.

**Tactics of Play**

When you are ready to go, your Dungeon Master will start telling you what the characters see. In beginning games, the characters often start at the dungeon entrance; the DM then describes the entryway, asking questions of the Caller when choices can be made ("Turn right or left?"). All the players should listen carefully to the descriptions, and play the roles of their characters as they react to the situations that develop. \\ The Marching Order will be used as the normal positioning of the characters as they proceed down corridors. In empty rooms and after battles, party members usually spread out to search for hidden treasure, but someone should be left to watch for approaching monsters. The DM will keep track of who is doing what, in case a monster appears. \\ When creatures are encountered, Fighters, Dwarves and Halflings usually move toward the encounter, while Magic-Users move back to avoid attacks, adding their magical powers to the battles where needed. Thieves may also move back, or may try to slip by the encountered creatures if possible. A Thief can help turn the tide of battle by attacking a monster from behind (if the creature doesn’t notice the Thief first). \\ Remember, however, that a clever DM may have monsters arrive at the rear of the party, occasionally when other monsters are at the front. The rear of the party should never be left defenseless. Clerics can often fill the need for a strong guard, as they can wear armor and fight well. \\ If an encounter is peaceful, those characters with high Charisma Scores should do most of the talking. If they are weak, negotiations should be made from a distance (ten to twenty feet is fine). \\ When special needs arise, those best equipped to handle them should move to the scene, while the rest of the characters stay in the Marching Order. For example, a Thief should move forward each time a door is found, to search for traps and pick locks. After doing the job, the Thief should move back into position. Thieves normally do not open doors, preferring to leave that task to the stronger Fighters in case there is a monster waiting on the other side! \\ File: \\ **Ending the Adventure**

The end of a D&D game often comes when the party’s resources have been used up — for example, when spell casters have used most of their spells, or when several characters are wounded (having lost half of their Hit Points, or more) and have no available magical cures. \\ Even if all goes well, the game should end 15-30 minutes before the planned stopping time. The remaining time is used by the DM to calculate and award Experience Points, and by the players to divide the treasure. \\ If characters are still in the dungeon when they decide to end the adventure, they must still find their way out and back home. When they have arrived at a safe location, the adventure ends. \\ Most Dungeon Masters allow shopping after the adventures, so characters may restock items used (such as oil, torches, and so forth). If this is left for the next game, players might forget to restock, and can find themselves short of supplies while deep in a dungeon. \\ Players must keep track of items used, and the DM should be strict about supplies. However, everyone should remember that the purpose of the game is to have fun, not bookkeeping. The DM should make allowances for beginners. \\ Characters who return to a safe place resume their normal day-to-day lives. Beginning players and DMs do not normally deal with this during games. The "town business" that would naturally occur can become an adventure in itself. If the DM has all the details of the Home Town available (either those given in the D&D EXPERT Set or details made up by the DM), town adventures can be very entertaining. They do not normally involve much fighting.

**Dividing the Treasure**

The amount of treasure your characters find is decided by the Dungeon Master, who places the treasures and monsters in the dungeons. The DM is also responsible for giving Experience Points to the characters at the end of the adventure. \\ The division of treasure is usually left to the players, though some DMs have their own rules for it, especially with well-developed fantasy worlds. There are several methods for dividing treasure, as both normal (coins, gems, and jewelry) and magical (potions, wands, etc.) treasures can be found. \\ As a rule, the division of treasure should not be based on the amount of work done by the different characters. Fighters will usually be more active than others, and thieves may have little to do; though the role may be played well, there may be few traps and locks to deal with. But each character risked danger in search of treasure, and each should have done special work as needed; it is not the character’s fault if few needs arose. \\ Beginning players should use the following method for dividing treasure. Other methods are discussed at the end of this booklet. But whatever methods are used, they should be decided upon //before//  the party goes on the adventure, to avoid arguments afterwards.

**Magical Treasure**

Magical treasures are usually divided first, as the results affect the division of normal treasure. \\ Each character may pick one item (each) from the magical treasure found. The order in which they choose may either be decided as a group or by random roll. If by random roll, each player rolls 1d20; the player with the highest roll picks first. If there is a tie, everyone rolls again. When all the magic items have been taken, divide the normal treasure.

**Normal Treasure**

Count the number of shares to be given, using the following method. \\ Some magic items are "permanent." A magic sword, for example, is never "used up," but a potion is only good for one use. A potion is called a "temporary" magic item. If all the characters in a party get a permanent magic item, divide all normal treasure equally, whatever the division of any temporary magic items. \\ If everyone gets a magic item but one or more of the items are temporary, each character with a permanent item gets Yz share of normal treasure. \\ If there are not enough magic items for one to be gained by each character then ½, share of normal treasure goes to each character with a temporary magic item, but a character with a permanent magic item gets no share of normal treasure. \\ Finally, divide the total normal treasure by the number of shares (adding the number of ½ shares and full shares according to the instructions above), to find the value of each SHARE. Each character then takes one share, ½ share, or no share, depending on the distribution of magic items. \\ This method is fair; those who receive permanent magic items, which can be used in every adventure, get less treasure.

==== Character Alignment ====

Three basic ways of life guide the acts of both player characters and monsters. Each way of life is called an **alignment**. The three alignments are named **Law**, **Chaos**, and **Neutrality**. Each alignment has a language that includes hand signals and other body motions. Player characters always know how to speak their alignment language in addition to any others they may know. If a monster is able to speak, it will also be able to use its alignment language. \\ Players may choose the alignments they feel will best fit their characters. A player does not have to tell other players what alignment he or she has picked, but must tell the DM. Most Lawful characters will reveal their alignment if asked. When picking alignments, the characters should know that Chaotics cannot be trusted, even by other Chaotics. A Chaotic character does not work well with other player characters. \\ The alignments give guidelines for characters to live by. The characters will try to follow these guidelines, but may not always be successful. If a DM feels that a player is not keeping to a character’s chosen alignment, the DM may suggest a change of alignment or give the character a punishment or penalty.

**Law**  (or **Lawful**) is the belief that everything should follow an order, and that obeying rules is the natural way of life. Lawful creatures will try to tell the truth, obey laws, and care about all living things. Lawful characters always try to keep their promises. They will try to obey laws as long as such laws are fair and just. \\ If a choice must be made between the benefit of a group or an individual, a Lawful character will usually choose the group. Sometimes individual freedoms must be given up for the good of the group. Lawful characters and monsters often act in predictable ways. Lawful behavior is usually the same as behavior that could be called "good."

**Chaos**  (or **Chaotic**) is the opposite of Law. It is the belief that life is random, and that chance and luck rule the world. Everything happens by accident and nothing can be predicted. Laws are made to be broken, as long as a person can get away with it. It is not important to keep promises, and lying and telling the truth are both useful. \\ To a Chaotic creature, the individual is the most important of all things. Selfishness is the normal way of life, and the group is not important. Chaotics often act on sudden desires and whims. They cannot be trusted, their behavior is hard to predict. They have strong belief in the power of luck. Chaotic behavior is usually the same as behavior that could be called "evil."

**Neutrality**  (or **Neutral**) is the belief that the world is a balance between Law and Chaos. It is important that neither side get too much power and upset this balance. The individual is important, but so is the group; the two sides must work together. \\ A Neutral character is most interested in personal survival. Such characters believe in their own wits and abilities rather than luck. They tend to return the treatment they receive from others. Neutral characters will join a party if they think it is in their own best interest, but will not be overly helpful unless there is some sort of profit in it. Neutral behavior may be considered "good" or "evil" (or neither), depending on the situation.

**Example of Alignment Behavior**

THE SITUATION: A group of player characters is attacked by a large number of monsters. Escape is not possible unless the monsters are slowed down.

A //Lawful//  character will fight to protect the group, whatever the danger. The character will not run away unless the whole group does.

A //Neutral//  character will fight to protect the group as long as it is reasonably safe to do so. If the danger gets too great, the character will try to save himself (or herself), even at the expense of the party.

A //Chaotic//  character might fight the monsters or might run away. The character will not care what happens to the rest of the party.

**Alignment Languages**

Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions. Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their alignment languages. They will also recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it. Alignment languages are not written down, nor may they be learned unless a character changes alignment. When this happens, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately. \\ Note that playing an alignment does not mean a character must do stupid things. A character should always act as intelligently as the Intelligence score shows, unless there is a reason to act otherwise (such as a magical curse).

==== Adventuring Rules ====

Here are some additional details you will need at some point during your adventures.

**Using Your Equipment**

Some of the standard equipment may be new to you. The following items can be used in various handy ways:

  * **Iron spikes and Hammer:**  These can be used to wedge doors open, provide grips for climbing, pry things loose, and so forth.**Mirror:**  Some creatures can turn you to stone with their gaze. If you use a mirror to look around corners, examine empty rooms, and so forth, you might avoid a nasty surprise.**Rations**  and Wineskin: Your character food and drink. Standard rations may become moldy and unusable if you stay in a dungeon overnight, so carry Iron (preserved) rations whenever possible. Standard rations are fine for long trips overland.**Rope:**  This can be tied to an iron spike and used to climb up steep walls. It may also be useful in tying up captured prisoners, pulling doors, open, etc.**Wolfsbane:**  This herb is useful when fighting werewolves and other lycanthropes. You may use it as a weapon — try it and see what happens.**Wooden Pole:**  A character in front of a party may sometimes avoid being surprised if a pole is used to tap on the floor ahead, poke into corners, touch suspicious-looking items, etc.
 \\ File: \\ **Time**

Time in D&D games is usually kept track of in //turns//  of 10 minutes in "game time." A turn is not a measure of real time, but is a measure of how much a character can do in the game in a given amount of time. \\ During encounters and combat, the DM uses //rounds//  of 10 seconds of ‘‘game time," instead of turns, and each character can perform only one action during a round — a swing of a sword, a spell, some movement, or other action. A battle normally lasts only a minute or two, but is counted as a full turn because your characters rest afterwards, clean up their equipment, and do other assumed normal actions. \\ In D&D games, it would take too long for you to describe each action your character takes. Many actions are assumed, and do not need to be talked about — such as eating, resting after and during travel, normal careful behavior, and so forth. The DM should decide how long any action takes. \\ Time for you, the players, is called "real time" to avoid confusion. A game usually takes 2-3 hours of real time, but may last for days in game time. The DM may say, for example, "you take two hours to walk to the dungeon, and . . . ." On the other hand, it may take you half an hour of real time to play a battle that lasts only a few minutes of game time.

**Movement**

In D&D games movement is given as the number of feet a character may move in one turn. \\ A single character moves up to 120’ per turn in a dungeon-like setting unless a lot of weight (such as armor) is carried. The movement speed may slow down to as little as 30‘ per turn, depending on the amount carried. Groups move at the rate of the slowest character. A character wearing heavy armor moves at half the normal rate: 60’ per turn. \\ Though 60’ per turn may seem very slow, it includes many assumed actions — mapping, peeking around corners, resting, and so forth. \\ During encounters, movement is much faster. Characters can move ⅓ their movement rate per round, up to 40’ per round during battles (20’ per round if in armor). In addition, you may run away from creatures, at the even faster rate of 120’ (or 60’ if armored) per round. However, you may only run for 20 rounds at most (5 minutes) before becoming exhausted. If you are exhausted, you must rest for 3 turns (30 minutes). \\ If you are forced to fight without rest, the exhausted characters are penalized in combat. Monsters gain a + 2 bonus to their Hit Rolls, and you must subtract 2 from all your characters’ Hit Rolls and Damage Rolls. (Any successful hit will still inflict at least 1 point of damage.)

**Listening**

You should always listen carefully while you are exploring a dungeon; you may hear noises that give clues about what lies ahead. To hear anything, all the characters must stop moving and be very quiet. Armor and weapons clank and rattle when you move, spoiling your attempts at listening. \\ To listen for noise, simply tell the DM that you are doing so. The DM will roll to see if you hear anything. When listening at closed doors, each character can try once. Thieves have better chances than other characters. Undead creatures, like skeletons and ghouls, make no noise at all.

**Light**

Most dungeons are dark. Be sure to bring a tinderbox, which contains wood shavings, flint rocks, and a small piece of steel. (No matches or lighters in this medieval world!) \\ You will also need something to light with your tinderbox. A torch is cheapest, and will burn for 6 turns (1 hour). It cannot easily be “turned off.” A lantern is more expensive and uses oil. One flask of oil will burn for 24 turns (4 hours) in a lantern. The lantern must then be refilled, using another flask of oil. A lantern has shutters, which can be closed for temporary darkness if desired. A torch or lantern shines 30’ in all directions. \\ If you are carrying a light source (a torch or lantern), other creatures will probably see the light as you approach, and will not be surprised. \\ Remember that you only have two hands. If you are carrying a light source in one hand, then the other hand may hold a weapon or a shield - but not both. \\ Dwarves and elves have Infravision, a special ability which enables them to see 60' in the dark by seeing heat. This means that they can move and fight without light, but it’s risky. They cannot see a pit in the floor, for example, unless it is warmer than the air above it. They may also stumble over objects which are the same temperature as the floor, unless they are very careful.

**Doors**

You will find two kinds of doors in dungeons, //normal//  and //secret//  doors. A **normal door**  is made of wood, and has metal reinforcing strips across it. Some have metal hinges, a ring or doorknob, and possibly a lock, either a padlock hanging on a latch or a lock inset into the door. Normal doors can often be forced or broken open, but a strong bar of wood mounted on the other side will prevent this. \\ To open a normal door, just tell your DM that you are doing so. The DM will assume that you are turning the handle, pulling the ring, or pushing on it gently. If it doesn’t open, you may tell the DM “I’ll force the door.” Your character is then using Strength to open it, which may be successful if the door is merely stuck quite (quite common in dungeons). If the door still does not open, it may be locked, barred, or closed magically; or your attempt might have simply been unsuccessful, based on a dice roll. Try again! However, if a door is not opened on the first try at forcing it, any monsters on the other side will not be surprised by your party.

A **secret door**  does not look like a door. It may simply be a section of wall that can be moved, or may be a small normal door hidden behind a curtain, rug, or some other furnishing. Any character may look for secret doors, but they are psually hard to find. Your DM will roll to see if you succeed, but you must tell the DM that you are searching for one, and where. It takes 10 minutes (1 turn) of searching a 10’ x 10’ area to find a secret door. Less time will mean automatic failure.

**Traps**

Dungeons often contain traps. Old ruins usually have more traps than caves. The most common trap is a hidden trap door, which falls open as a character walks on it, dumping the character into a pit. There could be something in the pit — spikes, deep water, or a monster. Beware! \\ Many other traps are possible. A chest or treasure may be coated with poison; deadly if touched, but easily removed by rinsing with water. Some poisons are sticky, and can only be removed with wine. A blade trap may be found nearly anywhere, and usually inflicts enough damage to kill a 1st or 2nd level character. \\ Doors may be trapped on the handles, locks, or surface. Small darts may be found inside a lock, and may be poisoned for many different effects (paralysis, damage, death, etc.). \\ If you wish to search for a trap, tell the DM where you are searching, and the DM will roll to see if you find anything. You might have no chance to find a small trap, such as the type on a door or treasure. Thieves have a percentage chance at detecting any type of trap. Dwarves have better chances at finding large traps (such as pits) than other characters. \\ It takes 10 minutes (1 turn) to search for a trap in a small area, such as a 20’ square room or a 20’ long section of corridor. If less time is spent, no trap will be found.

**Wandering Monsters**

You will usually encounter monsters in rooms, rather than corridors. But the DM makes dice rolls to see if any Wandering Monsters come by. This type of creature usually has little or no treasure, and is a dangerous nuisance. \\ Wandering monsters are often determined by the type of dungeon. For example, caves could contain wandering animals. A castle ruin might contain wandering skeleton guards.

**Miniature Figures**

As you try to imagine your characters and the areas they explore, it is helpful to use miniature figures to represent the characters and monsters. Several types of miniature figures are available from toy and hobby shops worldwide, made of metal or plastic and suitable for painting. You should be able to find figures that look very similar to your characters. Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS<sup>®</sup>   figures are available. \\ To keep track of the party marching order, line up the miniature figures on the playing table. You may use a large piece of graph paper to draw the rooms and corridors found by the characters, and simply move the figures around on the paper. Several types of more permanent playing surfaces are available in plastic and vinyl, and the rooms drawn on them can be easily erased.

**Scale Movement:**  When using miniature figures on a playing surface, a ruler is used to determine distance moved. One inch represents 10 feet. A movement rate of 60‘ per turn means that the figure moves 6 inches each turn. Spell ranges and other ranges are easily determined when an accurate scale is used.

===== Encounter Rules =====

**Surprise**

There is more to an encounter than just walking into a room and seeing a monster. For example, you might have sneaked up on the creature — or it might have sneaked up on you! You might turn a corner, and be completely surprised to find a monster right there. But if the monster is surprised, too, then you would both stop for a moment and look at each other. The mutual surprise on both sides would cancel out, for no effect except a short delay. \\ For example, let’s look back at your very first encounter - with the goblin. You entered the room, and the goblin screamed and swung his sword at you, but missed. You didn’t get to do anything before he had swung, because you were //surprised//. \\ In the one-player adventure in this booklet, surprise has already been worked out. The description tells you whether you or the monsters — or both! — are surprised. \\ In group adventures, you roll to see who is surprised, and by how much. A //six-sided die//  (1d6) is rolled for each side, and the results are compared in the following way:

You are only surprised if you roll a 1 or a 2; the same applies to the monsters.

  * If //both sides//  are surprised, neither side can move or fight during that round. The mutual surprise cancels out. For the next round, either side might go first, so another roll (on 1d6 again) is used to decide. This is called rolling for //Initiative//, and is described below.If //one side//  surprises the other, the surprised side must wait during the first round, while the other side acts. Those that can act might spend the time attacking, talking, or moving — even running away!If neither side is surprised, the DM must determine which side acts first in the round, by checking //Initiative//.

**Initiative**

When an encounter begins, you might act first, or the monster might go first. This is called Initiative. If you have the initiative, you get to act first, before the monster. \\ In all of your group’s encounters, you will roll to see who has the initiative. The DM rolls 1d6 for the monsters, and one of the players rolls 1d6 for the charactqrs. It doesn’t matter which player rolls. Whoever gets the higher number wins the initiative, and swings first. \\ When the party has the initiative, the characters may use the time to talk, attack, move (fighters moving to the front, for example), or run away. Some monsters will also have similar choices, but most will either talk or attack. Very few monsters run away before anything happens. \\ If a monster has more than one attack, it will get all of its attacks before yours if it wins the initiative. \\ If each side rolls the same number, then all the action happens at once; the actions are “simultaneous,” and neither side wins the initiative. Attacking characters can try to Hit, but whatever the result, the monsters may also make all of their attacks, even if you kill them with your first attacks!

**Pursuit and Evasion**

If either side decides to run away, the other side may chase. Time is measured in rounds for as long as the chase occurs. The side running away is “Evading,” and those chasing are in “Pursuit.” \\ File: \\ You may evade monsters if you can move faster than they can and if you know where you are going — so once again, a map becomes important. If the monsters are catching up, try dropping things! Unintelligent monsters may stop to eat food. Intelligent monsters may stop to pick up treasure. In each case, there is a 50% chance that the monsters will stop or slow down. Your DM will make all the necessary rolls.

----

ORDER OF COMBAT

----

  * A. Each side rolls for initiative, using 1d6.B. The side that wins the initiative acts first: * 1. Morale Check (monsters and non-player characters only)2. Movement (using speed per round), including Defensive Maneuvers3. Missile fire combat (additional) * a. Choose targetsb. Make Hit Rollsc. Roll Damage for hits4. Magic spells * a. Choose targetsb. Make Saving Throws if necessaryc. Apply results immediately5. Hand-to-Hand combat
      * a. Choose targetsb. Make Hit Rollsc. Roll Damage for hitsC. The side that loses the initiative then completes all the steps given above.D. The DM handles all retreating, surrender, and other special results.

----

**Combat Sequence**

During a battle, the actions do not all happen at once. Your DM will use a checklist to be sure that the battle is run properly. The list is also given here for your reference. \\ This Combat Sequence includes several optional rules. If you are not using the rule referred to (such as Missile Fire), simply skip that step. \\ Repeat steps A through D as needed until the battle is over.
