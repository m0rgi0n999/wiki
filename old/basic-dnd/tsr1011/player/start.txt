<WRAP col3 justify>

This is a game that is fun. It helps you imagine.

//"As you whirl around, your sword ready, the huge, red, fire-breathing dragon swoops toward you with a ROAR!"//

See? Your imagination woke up already. Now imagine: This game may be more fun than any other game you have ever played!\\
<wrap indent>The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS<sup>®</sup>  game is a way for us to imagine together—like watching the same movie, or reading the same book. But you can write the stories, without putting a word on paper—just by playing the D&D<sup>®</sup>  game.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You, along with your friends, will create a great fantasy story, you will put it away after each game, and go back to school or work, but—like a book—the adventure will wait. It’s better than a book, though; it will keep going as long as you like.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>It is nearly the most popular game ever made. And you will see why, in just a bit.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When you bought some other game or book, did you ever think, "Gee, that’s nice, but it’s not quite what I thought it would be"? Well, your D&D adventures will be just what you want, because you’re the one making them up!</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>And it’s not hard. It takes a little reading and a little thinking, but most of all, it’s fun.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>It’s fun when you discover that nobody loses, and everybody wins!</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>It’s fun when you get good at the game . . . for example, knowing what to expect in a kobold cave, and which dragons are on your side.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>And you don’t have to put in a coin each time, like many other games. Once you have these rules, you don’t need anything else.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>There’s more, of course, if you want it: exciting adventures to play, miniature figures of monsters and characters, expert rules for more experienced players, and lots more. But you already have everything you need to start: this package, and your imagination. That will do it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Ah, yes; it does cost one more thing, which you also have right now—a bit of time. It takes a few minutes to learn the basic rules, and another hour or two to play a full game. You will probably want to spend more time, and might even make it a hobby; millions of people have.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>But for now, just sit back and imagine.</wrap>\\
\\
//"Your character stands atop a grassy hill . . . the sun glints off your golden hair, rippling in the warm breeze . . . you absent-mindedly rub the gem-studded hilt of your magic sword, and glance over at the dwarf and elf, bickering as sual about how to load the horses . . . the magic-user has memorized her spells, and says he’s ready to go . . . a dangerous dungeon entrance gapes at you from the mountain nearby, and inside, a fearsome dragon awaits. Time to get moving. . .// \\
Have Fun!\\

===== How to use this book =====

You can learn how to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game by yourself, simply by reading the next sections of this booklet. You don’t have to memorize everything as you read; the first two adventures are designed to teach you while you play. If you are ready to learn, begin reading at **Start here**.\\
<wrap indent>The game is usually played in groups of 3 or more people. If you want to learn with others, it’s best if one person already knows how to play, and can teach the others. If not, you (or one of the others) may read the first adventure aloud, while everyone follows along, to learn the basics of the game. However, it’s better if each person can read the adventures separately.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When you all know how to play characters, read the sections **"DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Characters"** and **"Playing with a Group"**. One person must also learn how to be a Dungeon Master (or DM) - the person who plays the roles of the Monsters. The other booklet in this set is the DUNGEON MASTERS RULEBOOK, and explains everything the DM needs to know.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This set gives all the details for playing a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. With these rules, your characters can reach the 3rd level of experience. (These and other terms are explained later in this booklet.) Other sets are available, with more magic items and spells, monsters, and rules for bigger and better games.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Set #2 is the **D&D® EXPERT Rules**, for character levels 4th through 14th. The **D&D® COMPANION Rules** is Set #3, for characters levels 15th through 25th; and the **D&D® MASTERS Set** gives the remaining: details for character levels 26th through 36th.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Everything in these sets fits together to form a complete system for playing D&D fantasy role playing. You may use all or part of these rules. They often include several ways of playing and running the game. You may create new rules, monsters, and magic, using these rules as guidelines.</wrap>
