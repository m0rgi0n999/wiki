====== Solo adventure ======

In the following one-player adventure, you will explore a dungeon, looking for monsters and treasures. **Part 1** is a shopping trip in town. In **Part 2**, you will learn more about battles. And in **Part 3** you will visit the dungeon. You will often be given choices, and asked to pick one. Each choice gives a.number; turn to that number to find the results of your choice. Your adventure will continue from there.
===== Part 1: Town Business =====

You spend a few days in town, letting your wounds heal. Since you found so much treasure on your first adventure, you go shopping for some better armor. Armorer Baldwick knows you well. He’s a jolly fellow, getting a bit gray. You remember snitching apples from the big tree in his yard when you were young and foolish.\\
"Well, well!" he booms, as you enter his shop. "How have YOU been these days? All grown up now, I see!" You chat for a few minutes about your younger days, and then you ask if he has any armor that would fit you.\\
"Why, surely! Let me see, let me see . . ." He pushes his way through racks of armor of all kinds, as you follow closely behind. There are dozens of sets of armor, for people of all sizes, but most of them need repair.\\
"AHA!" he exclaims, pulling an armload of metal down. "Try this on!" The armor you are wearing is made of round chain links, all skillfully interwoven to form a covering for most of your body. But this armor is different. Large pieces of well-crafted metal are fastened to chain mail and leather, fashioned into pieces that you could wear. "Plate mail, of course; just finished it a week or two ago. Want to try it on? I think it’ll fit."\\
You go to a back room and remove your chain mail, and try this heavier armor on for size. Sure enough, it fits, almost as if it were made just for you. The metal plates hang from leather straps and chain mail links, forming a tough protective suit. But it’s very heavy, almost twice as heavy as your chain mail.\\
You come out to show him, and he walks around you, carrying a piece of charcoal and marking the armor here and there for some necessary adjustments.\\
"Looks good!" he exclaims. "Just a bit here, and a bit there . . . want to trade in that chain mail you had on? Looked to be in pretty good shape . . . ."\\
"Wait a minute!" you reply. "Don’t you have anything lighter than this stuff? I’m not going to be able to carry as much treasure if I wear all this metal!" "Ah, well!" he says, soothingly. "If you want better protection, you have to use this. Unless, of course, you can somehow find magical armor."\\
Plate mail will improve your Armor Class to AC 2, better than your current AC 4, so it would be nice to have.\\
"Well, how much?" you ask.\\
"Well . . . 75 gold pieces as is. Want to trade in that chain mail?" he repeats.\\
"Oh, I guess so," you reply. "How much?"\\
"For you, well . . . since you’re trying to get started, and since I’ve known you so long . . . 50 gold pieces, with your trade-in."\\
You talk with him a bit more, using your Charisma, and bargain him down to a better price.\\
"Okay, OKAY!" he says finally. "Just 30 gold pieces with the trade-in, and you promise to come here first the next time you need better armor or more weapons. Agreed!" He stomps off, grumbling, then stops and turns. "You can pick it up Tuesday. Pay the clerk on your way out!"\\
Subtract 30 gold pieces worth of coins from the Money on your character sheet. You can either subtract it from your gp, or use some coins of lesser value if you understand the Conversion Table. Change the numbers on your sheet to account for your spending, and change your Equipment List. Then turn the sheet over, and change your Armor Class to 2.\\
You come back to the shop in a few days and pick up your heavy Plate Mail (it’s not ready on Tuesday, but you have time to wait). You spend the time looking around for other adventurers — any help would be welcome — but the few you find all just want to relax, have a good time, and heal up from their last adventures.\\
So, fully equipped but still alone, you set off one morning for the caves near town, remembering to watch out for ghouls.

===== Part 2: Battles =====

You are almost ready to enter the "dungeon." But first, you need to learn a little more about battles.\\
You already know how to swing at a monster:

----

  * You roll 1d20 (a twenty-sided die), and compare the result to the Hit roll given in the description. If you rolled that number or higher, you hit the enemy, and roll Damage.

----

==== More Damage! ====

In your first adventure, each time you hit a monster you.did 1 point of damage. However, from now on, you will roll 1d6 (a six-sided die) to see how much damage you do to the creature you are fighting. \\ You will keep track of the damage in the same way, writing down the starting number and subtracting the damage each time you hit. Just cross off the old number of hit points, and write down the new number.

==== The Monsters ====

Monsters will also be able to do more damage. In your one-player games, you will keep track of their damage on a separate sheet of paper along with your own. In group games, the Dungeon Master keeps track of all the monster details. \\ Some monsters do 1-6 points of damage, just as you do. But sometimes they do more or less than 1d6. Each time you encounter a monster, the information you need will be given in a box, like this:

----

----

The number after the monster’s name is the roll it needs to hit your fighter. "D" is the dice to roll after the monster hits, to find the amount of damage .it did to you. The monster’s hit points are also given. \\ In this example, if you roll a 12 or higher, you hit the goblin. You then roll 1d6, the standard amount, and add 2 (for your Strength bonus). You subtract that total from the goblin’s 4 hp (as given above). If the goblin’s new total is zero or less, the creature is dead. If the goblin still has any hit points left, it swings at you: \\ If you roll a 17 or higher for the goblin’s attack, he hits you, for 1-6 points of damage as noted in the box above. You roll the six-sided die and subtract the result from your 8 hit points.

==== Combat Checklist ====

A step-by-step list of everything you need to do when fighting a monster is given on the same page as the monster description (the boxed information). Use this checklist for every battle, to be sure you are running each one correctly.

==== Record Keeping ====

Use a piece of scrap paper to keep track of the battles. Whenever you find some treasure, write down the amount and type on the same paper. Experience points will be given at the end of the adventure, but you will need a list of the creatures your fighter conquers. All the points for treasure and experience will be added up at the end of the adventure.

==== Getting Killed ====

If your character is slain by the monsters, that is the end of the adventure. But it’s not the end of the game! You can start the fighter over again, pretending that it is a new character. \\ If you play this adventure a second time, do not keep any treasure found before you "got killed!" You should start the character over again, from the beginning.

----

  * Remember that you are carrying a magical Potion of Healing. If you get hurt, you can drink it, and it will cure all your damage. You can then change your hit points back to 8. You can only drink it once, and then it’s gone.

You may drink the potion whenever you wish, but you should wait until you have only 2 or 3 hit points left, if possible. If you drink it in the middle of a battle, you must skip your attack (you are drinking, not swinging), and roll only for the monster’s attack for that round of combat.

----

^THINGS TO REMEMBER|
|1.  |
|2.  |
|3.  |
|4.  |

==== Mapping ====

This time, you will make a map of the dungeon so you don’t get lost. Maps also help in remembering where the worst monsters were — like the ghouls — so you can avoid them until you feel ready for them. \\ You will draw your map on a piece of graph paper. Each line one square long will equal 10 feet in the dungeon. Copy each map carefully. Draw an arrow pointing to the top of the paper and label it "North", then draw a line across the arrow and label "East, South, and West." This will help you remember the directions. \\ As you draw your maps be sure to write notes on it to help you remind you where things are. \\ If you don’t make a map as you go, you will probably get confused.

===== Part 3: Into The Caves =====

Since you explored some of the caves earlier, you find yet another entrance to venture into this time. After finding a suitable cave, you pause to be sure you are ready. \\ The caves are dark and dreary, as you remember from the last time, so you get out your lantern and light the wick, using your tinderbox. Then, carefully, you step into the first "room." \\ Tear the sheet of graph paper out of the center of this booklet. Then, starting near the bottom, copy **Entry 1 Map:**

The room you are in is fifty feetsquare, with 10’ wide exits in the middle of the north, south, east, and west walls. The ceiling of the room is 15’ up, but the corridors are only 10’ tall. \\ The walls, floor, and ceiling are made of rough rock. There are some cracks and crevices in the rock walls, all very small. Standing in the exact center of the room is a stone statue of a woman in armor. You examine it carefully, and finally even touch it - but it is merely a statue, nothing magical or special. \\ You have entered this 50’ square room by the southern corridor, which leads out to fresh air and sunlight. The other corridors are dark. The light from your lamp helps, but shadows linger in the corners of this large room. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ You are back outside! If you want to go back inside, read #1. If you want to quit, stop reading here; your fighter goes back to town. If you killed any monsters or found any treasure, read 88 to find how many Experience Points you have earned. If you want to go shopping for supplies, read 89.

You go south, and leave the caves. You may go home, and end this adventure, or you can go back to the first room. Read 2 for further instructions.

You go south from the strange room. If you have already killed the monsters and taken the treasure from this part of the dungeon, read 23. If not, read 44.

You decide to go back to the statue room. Return to 1.

You go back to the statue room. Read 58.

You turn the corner and follow the passage back to a room. Read 9.

After the turn, the corridor goes 50‘ west and opens into a room. Read 54 after you add **Entry 8 Map**  to yours:

You may go one of three ways. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ If you have already killed the monsters and taken the treasure from this part of the dungeon, read 9. If not, continue: \\ The corridor goes 20’ north from the room and then turns right. You peek around the corner, and see that the corridor goes 20’ and opens into another room. Read 54.

You quietly approach the room, and you don’t see anything unusual. But as you step into the room, some giant rats leap out from the corner to your right, and attack! Two of them hit you, for a total of 3 points of damage. You are suddenly in battle, and cannot escape. Read 83.

Talking to the creature doesn’t do any good. It attacks, and gets one free swing while you are talking! Read 86, and run the battle normally after giving the monster one free attack.

You kill the two skeletons! As each one "dies," its bones collapse in a heap, and the rusty sword drops to the floor with a clang. \\ You search the area, but find no treasure. However, there is a door in the east wall of the room. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ You go west, and come to another room. It has an exit south, leading outside, and another corridor heading west. You don’t want to go west, the ghouls are in that direction. \\ You recognize this room as the entrance for your very first adventure! This is where you hit the goblin, and he ran away. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ If you have already killed all the monsters in this part of the dungeon, read 61. If not, continue: \\ The corridor goes north and opens into a room. The area looks like **Entry 15 Map**  (add it to your map): \\ As you peer into the room, you see two skeletons with rusty swords standing about 10’ from you, around the corner. Without making a sound, they step forward, grinning horribly, and swing at you. One of them hits, for 2 points of damage. Read 26.

File:

You are leaving the Rust Monster room, heading west. Have you mapped this part of the dungeon yet? \\  \\  \\ The corridor goes north 30’, and then there is a side passage to the left (west). The main corridor continues another 30’ and then turns left. When you get to the side passage, you see that it goes 10’ west and opens into a strange room. Read 49.

You carefully enter the room, and see two goblins in a far corner. They have swords, and seem to be expecting you. They attack, and each gets a free swing before you can react. Read 85 and run the battle normally, but give each goblin one free swing to start.

You think that there are goblins up here, so you keep your lantern shuttered and sneak up to peek into the room. You hear soft talking in a language you don’t understand. \\ Peeking around the corner, you see two goblins to your right, at the south end of the room. They seem to be talking about something and don’t notice you. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ You decide to leave the goblins alone. But as you start to back off, the goblin you have been talking to draws its sword and attacks! The other one leaves, going north and turning left. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ If you have already explored this area, please read 52. If not, then continue: \\ Starting from the north wall of this room, the corridor goes 10’ north, turns left (west) and goes 10‘ further, opening into the east wall of another room. There are more goblins here! But when they see you, they shriek and run through a stout door on the north wall, slamming it behind them. The room looks like Entry 21 Map (add it to your map): \\ You search the room carefully and find one small bag by the door, apparently dropped by one of the goblins. The bag contains 10 sp, 5 gp, and — a key! Now do you want to: \\  \\  \\ If you have been in this room before, please read 39. Otherwise, continue: \\ You enter the strange room to investigate. The room is empty and clean, and the only feature is the orange mouth on the far wall, about 8’ long. The room looks like **Entry 22 Map**  (add it to your map): \\ You search the room, listening and looking carefully, but you find nothing. Suddenly, as you are about to leave, the lips of the giant mouth move, and in a big booming bass voice it says, "Surprise! You are here for double-or-nothing! Ready or not, here we go. O-T-T-F-F-S-S. What’s next in line? If you solve this riddle, your treasure will double. If you fail, it will all disappear. What is your answer?" \\ If you try to leave, you find the way blocked by an invisible force. "You //must//  answer, y’know!" bellows the mouth. \\ Think about it, and decide what the answer is. Then read 82.

You go back to the room where the giant rats were and continue through, arriving back at the first room. Read 58.

You suddenly feel different (either more or less weiqhted down, depending File:

on your answer). Whatever answer you gave, the mouth laughs and says "Come back again some time!" The invisible barrier is gone, and you can leave the room. You cannot find anything more here, nor will the mouth speak to you again. Read 40.

You decide that the rats look dangerous, and you head back the way you came. The rats don’t notice. Read 58.

You are facing two skeletons. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ You carefully examine the door, and fine nothing strange about it. There is a keyhole in it. Have you found a key? \\  \\  \\ The corridor goes only 10’ west before connecting to another corridor heading north; the main corridor continues west, into darkness. The north corridor goes 30‘ and opens into a room. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ You go back to the statue room. Read 58. File:

The skeletons ignore your chatter, and swing again. One of them hits you, doing 2 more points of damage. Return to 26.

You go north from the strange room. If you have already been through this part of the dungeon, read 7. If not, read 8.

You decide to go back. The goblins don’t notice you, and you return to the statue room. Read 58.

You decide to attack the goblins before they can get help. You leap out and block the first goblin’s escape, and they both draw swords and attack you. Read 85 and run the battle normally.

As you keep talking to the goblin you see 3 more coming from the north. They look mad. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ Although you try to talk to them, the goblins are ferocious and ready for a fight. One swings and hits you, for 2 points of damage. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ You decide to go back to the start. Going west from here, the corridor turns south. You follow it back to the statue room. Read 58.

You go back to the room where you first found the goblins. Read 9. File:

You go east down the long corridor, around the corner heading south, and come to the side passage leading into the strange room. Read 49.

The mouth roars, "YOU again?! Go away, pest!" You can’t find anything of value here. Read 40.

From here, do you want to: \\  \\  \\ The creature is feasting on rust, and ignores you. You run past it through the room and arrive back at the statue room. Read 58.

File:

You stop and listen, and hear squeaking noises to the east. Go back to 1.

The corridor goes 20’ to the west and opens into a room, which looks like **Entry 43 Map**  (add it to your map): \\ The room is empty, except for a few small piles of reddish dust. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ As you approach a room, a giant rat jumps out of the shadows and bites you! You see 2 more giant rats in the room. Take 2 points of damage, and read 83.

You go into the room and look around. There is nothing here but the reddish dust. When you look closely at the dust, however, you realize that it’s rust! \\ You hear a snort, and when you look up, you see a strange looking creature coming into the room from the western corridor. It looks like a giant armadillo with a long tail, and has 2 feathery feelers on the front. \\ It charges at you! Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ You try to bash the door open without using a key, but without success. The solid door remains securely closed. You eventually give up, passing the scattered skeleton bones as you head out to the main corridor. Read 62.

You try to Turn’ the skeletons like the cleric Aleena Turned the ghouls, but nothing happens. It’s a special talent that clerics have, not fighters. Each skeleton swings at you again, but they both miss. Return to 26.

You get back to the Rust Monster room. Did you kill the Rust Monster? \\  \\  \\ You may go in and investigate the strange room, or you can go north or south. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ You greet the goblins in your own language, the Common Tongue. They look up, startled, and one growls something in its own language. The other smiles at you, and says "Why, hello there! What can we do for you?" The growling goblin starts heading north, apparently leaving the room. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ You try to keep talking, but the goblin attacks; it misses. You suddenly hear more goblin noises to the north, and see 2 more goblins coming, with their swords out and looking very angry. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\ You go around the corner and look in the room, but nobody is there. There is nothing here to find, so you go back around the corner to the last room you were in. Read 9.

If you have already mapped this of the dungeon, read 38. If not, continue: \\ The corridor goes 50’ east from the room and then turns right, to the south. Peering around the corner, you see that the corridor goes 30’ south, and a side passage then opens to the west. When you get to that point, you see that the side passage goes 10‘ west and opens into another room, with blue walls and a huge orange mouth on the opposite wall. Read 49 after you add **Entry 53 Map**  to your map:

The room looks like **Entry 54 Map**  (add it to your map): \\ What are you expecting here? If you didn’t find or hear any clues, read 18. If you found some information about the creatures in this direction, read 19 instead.

You continue through the Rust Monster room, and get back to the statue room. Read 58. File:

As you turn to run away, the monster quickly attacks, and gets in your way. You cannot retreat! Read 86.

You search the room carefully, and you find a small scrap of’paper in a niche (small hole) in one wall. Opening it, you discover a note, written in the Common tongue: \\  \\ You can also see parts of the corridors leading out of the room, which look like **Entry 57 Map**. \\ You find nothing else in the room. Return to 1.

From this room, you can go many ways. Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ As you approach the room, you hear more squeaks.

Your armor, shield, sword, and dagger have all been turned to rust by the fearsome Rust Monster! But now that you have no more metal, the creature turns away from you, not interested any more.

There are gems here and there, some covered by rust; you collect six of them! Their total value is 300 gp. \\ Since you are unprotected and unarmed, you go east to the first room and then go outside, heading for town. \\ To find how many Experience Points you have earned, read 88.

You have won the great goblin fight. Congratulations! It was a tough battle for one lonely fighter. Don’t forget that you started the adventure with a Potion of Healing, which can cure all your damage if you haven’t already used it. \\ Searching the area, you find 100 sp and 50 gp in small sacks that the goblins were carrying.

You put the key in the lock and turn until you hear it "click." Putting the key away you open the door. \\ There is a small room behind the door! The area looks like **Entry 80A Map**  (add it to your map): \\ The room is empty except for one large chest by one wall. You walk over to it, and discover that it’s made of heavy wood with metal bands around it. It isn’t locked (luckily), so you carefully open it. But alas - it’s trapped. Make a saving throw vs. Magic Wands! (You need to roll a 13 or higher on 1d20.) \\ This Saving Throw is used for many things. Generally, it indicates whether you jump out of the path of danger — such as the beam of a magic wand. However, in this case, the danger is a blade, mounted on the edge of the chest and connected to a metal spring. When you open the lid, the blade sweeps out toward you. \\ If you made the Saving Throw, you jump back as the blade misses you. However, if you missed the Saving Throw, you take 4 points of damage! \\ If you are struck down to zero hit points or less, you can grab your potion — if you still have it - and drink it before you pass out. It will cure you somewhat, but only back up to 4 hit points. If you don’t have the potion left — sorry, but you are dead! (//Special note://  In group games, you will //not//  be allowed to do this. Zero hit points indicates death, with no extra time to do anything.) \\ If the trap kills you, read 90. But if you survived the trap, continue reading. \\ You look in the chest and see hundreds of coins - 500 cp, 200 sp, and 200 ep. You start to close the chest and drag it out with you. But as you close the lid, you see a peep hole in the north wall, about an inch across. It was blocked by the door as you entered. File: You look through, and see a short corridor that goes north 20‘ and turns left. To the east, by the turn, is a large door with two stout bars across it. A goblin is standing by the door, apparently on guard. The area looks like **Entry 80B Map**. \\ There is a crack in the wall near this peep hole. You suddenly realize that the crack might be the edge of a secret door! This treasure chest must belong to goblins! However, you can’t open the secret door, so you drag the chest back out, past the scattered bones of the dead skeletons and south to the main corridor. Read 62.

Oops! As you enter the room, the Rust Monster looks up from its feeding, grunts, and runs toward you. It rushes to the chest you are dragging, and before you can escape, it dissolves the metal bands around the chest. The chest comes apart, coins falling everywhere, and the creature gleefully turns all the coins to rust! Do you want to: \\  \\  \\  \\ If you guess the answer correctly, you may double the amount of treasure you have.

Use the checklist to be sure that you are running the battle correctly. \\ If the rust monster hits you, it does no damage at all. Instead, it makes metal turn to rust! As you run the battle, use the following notes to find the effects of each hit. \\ If you decide to run away, the monster gets one free attack, but only needs a Hit Roll 9 or better. You can run away after that, but you can only run either east (back to the statue room) or west. If you run east, read 1; if you go west, read 28. \\ If you kill the rust monster, read 70. \\ If you have been here before, you might not have some of the items mentioned below. Resume the battle wherever you left off, and remember to keep track of the equipment you have left.

  * **First Hit:**  your shield turns to rust and falls apart. Now the Rust Monster only needs an 11 or better to hit you. Read the "Special Note" below.**Second Hit:**  Your Armor turns to rust. Now the creature only needs a roll of 6 or higher to hit.**Third Hit:**  Your sword turns to rust! You must get out a dagger if you want to continue the fight.**Fourth Hit:**  Your dagger turns to rust! You have no more weapons. Read 60.
//Special Note://  When you lose your armor or shield, you become easier to hit. All monsters you encounter afterward will gain bonuses to their Hit Rolls. If you lose your shield, give them a +1 bonus. If you lose your armor, give them a total bonus of + 7 to their Hit Rolls. \\ Note this special bonus on your scrap paper, and apply it to all battles until you get new armor or shield.

You are fighting three goblins!

Remember to make three rolls for the monsters; each one gets a swing after you take yours. \\ Use the checklist to be sure that you are running the battle correctly \\  \\  \\  \\ When you complete this adventure, you get Experience Points. First, add up all the treasure you brought out of the dungeon (ignore anything you lost), and figure out how much it is all worth, in gold pieces. (The explanation of the Money system is on page 10.) You will get 1 XP for each 1 gp worth of treasure you find — in addition to getting the treasure. \\ After adding up the treasure, find out how much Experience you get for slaying monsters, according to this chart:

|Giant Rats  |5  |each|
|Goblins  |5  |each|
|Skeletons  |10|each|
|Rust Monster|300|   |

Add that total to your treasure total to get the total number of Experience Points awarded for this adventure. To determine your + 10% bonus, drop the last number, and add it to the total awarded. Then add the adjusted total XP earned to the current XP on the back of your character sheet, to find your new total overall. To finish up, add the treasure you found to the money you already had. Looking on the conversion chart, you see that 100 cp = 1 gp; 100 sp = 10 gp. Adding that to the gem value, your newlv found treasure is worth a total of 611 gp. \\ For monsters, you get 300 XP for the rust monster, plus 15 XP for the giant rats (5 each). That total is 315. Adding it to the 611 for treasure, your total XP award is 926. \\ To find your 10% bonus, drop the 6. Add the bonus of 92 to the award of 926, for an adjusted total XP of 1018. Then you add that to your current 523 XP, for a new total XP of 1541 — less than 500 XP from 2nd Level! Lastly, you add the actual treasure — 6 gems (worth 600 gp), 100 cp, and 100 sp — to your treasure list.

That finishes this adventure. You may go to the next adventure, or you may wish to go shopping. If you want to buy something now, read 89.

You want to go shopping. Instead of making an adventure out of it (like the beginning of this trip), you may simply imagine that you are visiting the various shops in town, buying whatever you need. The items you may buy — armor, weapons, and other equipment — are listed below, along with their prices. \\ To make a shopping trip, first write down the items you want, and their prices, on a piece of scrap paper. Then add up the total cost. If you can afford what you want, subtract that total cost from your treasure. Write the items in the "Normal Items" section on the back of the Character Sheet. Be sure to write the new total treasure in the Money box.

(Note: There are more weapons and equipment available in group adventures. See the complete list in the center of this book.)

Your character has been lost in the dungeon. Don’t be upset; it can happen in any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, and often does, through no fault of yours. That is the end of this adventure. \\ You may start over, if you wish. To do that, be sure not to keep any treasure you may have found before you died. The character should have exactly the same equipment, treasure, and hit points as when you started this adventure. In other words, you start over. If you want to do this, read 1.

==== After the adventure . . . ====

A map of the entire dungeon is given here. Check your map against it to see if you made any mistakes. \\ If you had problems with any part of the dungeon, go back and read the difficult section again. Now that you have learned the basics of the game, you will probably see what went wrong.
