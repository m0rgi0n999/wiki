A rather common omnivorous mammal. bears tend to avoid humans unless provoked. Exceptions to this rule can be a most unfortunate occurrence.\\
Bears are, in general, large and powerful animals which are found throughout the world's temperate and cooler climates. With dense fur protecting them from the elements and powerful claws protecting them from other animals, bears are the true rulers of the animal kingdom in the areas where they live.\\
The so-called black bear actually ranges in color from black to light brown. It is smaller than the brown bear and the most widespread species by far.

<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Combat:**</font> Although black bears are usually not aggressive, they are able fighters when pressed. If a black bear scores a paw hit with an 15 or better it also hugs for 2-8 (2d4) points of additional damage.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Habitat/Society:**</font> All bears have excellent senses of hearing and smell but rather poor eyesight. The size shown is an average for the variety and larger individuals will. of course. be correspondingly more powerful.\\
One common misconception people hold about bears is that they hibernate during the winter. In fact. they sleep most of the time. but their metabolism does not slow down. and they often wake up and leave their lairs during warm spells.\\
Bears live in small family groups. Female bears are very protective of their young. and more than one individual has been badly injured when taunting or playing with seemingly harmless bear cubs.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Ecology:**</font> All of these ursoids are omnivorous, although the gigantic cave bear tends towards a diet of meat.\\
Bears are fairly intelligent animals that can be trained to perform in a variety of ways, particularly if captured as cubs. Bears can thus be found dancing in circuses or accompanying "mountain men" in the wilderness.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Brown Bear**</font>\\
The brown hear, of which the infamous grizzly is the most well known variety, is a bear of very aggressive disposition. Brown bears are more carnivorous than their smaller cousins, the black bears. The grizzly in particular will often bring down large game such as deer and elk.\\
Brown bears are aggressive hunters. if a brown bear scores a paw hit with a roll of 13 or better it will also hug for 2-12 (2d6) points of additional damage. Brown bears will continue to fight for 1-4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -8 hit points. At -9 or fewer hit points, they are killed immediately.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Cave Bear**</font>\\
Cave bears are quite aggressive, willing to attack well-armed parties without provocation. if a cave bear scores a paw hit with an 18 or better it also hugs for 2-16 (2d8) points of additional damage. Cave bears will continue to fight for 1â€”4 melee rounds after reaching 0 to -3 hit points. At -9 or fewer hit points. they are killed immediately.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Polar Bear**</font>\\
These powerful swimmers feed mostly on marine animals. A paw hit of 18 or better indicates a "hug", which inflicts 3-18 (3d6) points of additional damage. These aggressive animals will fight for 2-5 rounds after being brought to 0 to -12 hit points, but beyond that they will die instantly.
