Silver dragons are kind and helpful. They will cheerfully assist good creatures if their need is genuine. They often take the forms of kindly old men or fair damsels when associating with people.\\
<wrap indent>At birth, a silver dragon's scales are bluegray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly lightens to brightly gleaming silver. An adult or older silver dragon has scales so fine that the individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Silver dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all good dragons, and 16% of hatchling silver dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Combat:**</font> Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use feather fall to stop any missiles fired at them. They use wall of fog or control weather to blind or confuse opponents before making melee attacks. If angry, they will use reverse gravity to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. When faced with flying opponents, a silver dragon will hide in clouds (often creating some with control weather on clear days), remain there using cloud walking, then jump to the attack when they have the advantage.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Breath weapon special abilities:**</font> A silver dragon has two breath weapons: a cone of //cold// 80' long, 5' wide at the dragon's mouth. and 30' wide at the end or a cloud of paralyzation gas 50' long, 40' wide, and 20' high. Creatures caught in the gas must save versus breath weapon or become paralyzed for one minute per age level of the dragon, plus 1-8 minutes. Creatures caught in the cold are allowed a save versus breath weapon for half damage. A silver dragon casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 6th level, plus its combat modifier.\\
<wrap indent>At birth. silver dragons are immune to cold, and can polymorph self three times a day. Each change in form lasts until the dragon chooses a different form and reverting to their normal form does not count as a change. They also can cloud walk. This allows the dragon to tread on clouds or fog as though they were solid ground. The ability functions continuously, but can be negated or resumed at will. As they age. they' gain the following additional powers: //Young: feather fall// twice a day. //Juvenile: wall of fog// once a day. //Adult: control winds// three times a day. //Mature adult: control weather// once a day. //Old: reverse gravity// once a day.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Habitat/Society:**</font> Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks, or amid the clouds themselves. When they lair in clouds there always will be an enchanted area with a solid floor for laying eggs and storing treasure.\\
<wrap indent>Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and often have mortal companions. Frequently they share deep friendships with mortals. Inevitably, however, the dragon reveals its true form and takes its leave to live a dragonâ€™s life For a time.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Ecology:**</font> Silver dragons prefer human food, and can live on such fare indefinitely.\\
<wrap indent>Because they lair in similar territories, silver dragons come into conflict with red dragons. Duels between the two species are furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get the upper hand since they are more capable of Working together against their foes and often have human allies.</wrap>
