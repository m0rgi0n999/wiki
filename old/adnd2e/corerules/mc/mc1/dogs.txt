<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Blink Dogs:**</font>\\
Blink dogs are yellowish brown canines which are stockier and more muscular than other wild dogs. They are intelligent and employ a limited form of teleportation when they hunt.\\
A blink dog attack is well organized. They will blink to and from without any obvious pattern, using their powers to position themselves for an attack. Fully 75% of the time they are able to attack their targets from the rear. A dog will teleport on a roll of 7 or better on a 12-sided die. To determine where the dog appears, roll a 12-sided die: 1 = in front of opponent, 2 = shielded (or left) front flank, 3 = unshielded (or right) front flank, 4-12 = behind. Wen blinking, the dog will appear from 1â€˜ to 3' feet from its opponent and will immediately be able to attack.\\
Blinking is an innate power and the animal will never appear inside a space occupied by a solid object. If seriously threatened, the entire pack will blink out and not return.\\
Blink dogs are intelligent. and communicate in a complex language of barks. yaps, whines, and growls. They inhabit open plains and avoid human haunts. A lair will contain 3-12 (3d4) pups 50% of the time (1-2 hit dice, 1-2/1-3 hit points damage/attack), These puppies can be trained and are worth between 1,000 to 2,000 gold pieces.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Death dog:**</font>\\
Death dogs are large two-headed hounds which are distinguished by their penetrating double bark. Death dogs hunt in large packs.\\
Each head is independent, and a bite does 1-10 points of damage. Victims must save versus poison or contract a rotting disease which will kill them in 4-24 (4d6) days. Only a cure disease spell can save them. A natural roll of 19 or 20 on their attack die means that a man-sized opponent is knocked prone and attacks at a -4 until able to rise to its feet again. There is an 85% chance that death dogs will attack humans on sight.
