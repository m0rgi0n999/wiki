The displacer beast is a magical creature which resembles a puma with two powerful black tentacles growing from its shoulders. They are very rare, and inhabit spots far from human lands.\\
The displacer beast has the blue-black coloring of a dark panther with a long cat-like body and head. Females range in size from 8’ to 9’, and weigh 450 pounds. Males can vary in size from 10' to 12’, and weigh up to 500 Lbs. Unlike the panther, however, the displacer beast has 6 legs. Its black tentacles are tipped with rough horny edges which can inflict terrible wounds upon its foes. The eyes of a displacer beast glow bright green even after the death of the creature itself.

<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Combat:**</font> The displace: beast is a fierce, savage creature which hates all forms of life. Highly aggressive, the displacer beast will attack on sight, using its tentacles to inflict 2—8 (2d4) points of damage to its victims.\\
Their main advantage in combat, however. stems from their magical power of displacement, which causes them to appear to be some 3' from their actual location. Anyone attacking a displacer beast receives a -2 on his attack roll. In addition, these monsters make their saving throws as 12th level fighters, gaining an additional +2 to their die roll.\\
To determine the true position of the displacer beast and its illusionary form roll 1d10. On a result of 1-5 the illusion is in front of the creature, 6-7 to the creature's left, 8-9, to the right. and 10 the the illusion is behind the actual position of the beast. Although the displacement ability is magical, the location of the animal will not be revealed by a dispel or detect magic. Only true seeing will reveal the true position of the displacer beast.\\
Displacer beasts will not use their claws or teeth unless near death or when fighting a very large opponent. if they do employ these secondary weapons each claw does 1-3 points of damage, and each bite does 1-8 points of damage.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Habitat/Society:**</font> Displacer beasts are carnivores who survive by hunting. Unless they are in the process of raising young, they generally run in packs, carving a savage swath of destruction as they go. They hate all life, and will sometimes kill purely for pleasure. Fierce and vicious as they are, however, displacer beasts never fight among themselves. The pack is a well run and highly efficient killing machine. When encountered en masse, displacer beasts are more than a match for many large creatures and have been known to make a meal of orcs, goblins, and bands of men. Any being entering their terrain is viewed as potential prey.\\
Displacer beasts mate in the autumn, and the young are born in the spring. A mated pair of displacer beasts makes its home in a cave, producing litters of 1-4 young. The cubs. about the size of domestic cats, are born without tentacles and reach maturity, but not full size, within 4 months. They remain in the cave until their displacement abilities are fully developed. This is followed by a 2 month period during which the cubs are taught how to hunt by their parents. When this is completed, the family group disbands and the monsters wander off to join separate packs. While raising young, however, the monsters are fiercely protective of their lair. One adult will always remain with the cubs, usually the female, while the other goes off to hunt. Dead prey will be dragged back to the lair to be devoured by the entire family. The lair of a displacer beast family is littered with the bones, equipment, and treasures of its victims.\\
Naturally vicious and almost evil at times, the displacer beast has an undying hatred of the blink dog. Many theories abound to account for this enmity. Some say it springs from antipathy in temperaments, and that the lawful good blink dog would naturally be the enemy of a creature as savage and destructive as the displacer beast. Some argue that it is the displacement and blinking abilities which are the cause for this antipathy, and that the two abilities, when in close proximity, somehow stimulate the nervous system and produce a hostile reaction. Encounters between the two kinds are rare however, since they do not share the same territory.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Ecology:**</font> The displacer beast has little to fear from other large predators, save perhaps large trolls or giants. Some wizards and alchemists value the hide of displacer beasts for use in certain magical preparations. and will offer generous rewards for them. The eyes of a displacer beast are a highly prized, if uncommon, good luck charm among thieves who believe that they will protect the bearer from detection.
