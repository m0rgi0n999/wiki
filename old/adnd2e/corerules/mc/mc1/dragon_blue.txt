The size of a blue dragon’s scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. The scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, retaining a glossy ﬁnish through all of the dragon’s stages because the blowing desert sands polish them.

<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Habitat/Society:**</font> Blue dragons are found in deserts; arid. windswept plains; and hot, humid badlands. They enjoy the bleak terrain because there are Pew obstacles—only an occasional rock outcropping or dune to interrupt the View of their territories. They spend hours looking out over their domains, watching for trespassers and admiring their property.
