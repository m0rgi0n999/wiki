<WRAP col2 80em>
Though their lives span several human generations. elves appear at first glance to be frail when compared to man. However, elves have a number of special talents that more than make up for their slightly weaker constitutions.\\
<wrap indent>High elves, the most common type of elf, are somewhat shorter than men, never growing much over than 5 feet tall. Male elves usually weigh between 90 and 120 pounds, and female elves only weigh between '70 and 100 pounds. High elves are dark-haired, and their eyes are always a beautiful, deep shade of green—and have infravision up to 60 feet. The features of an elf are delicate and finely chiseled.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elves are very pale of complexion, which is odd because they spend a great deal of time outdoors. They also tend to be slim, looking almost fragile. Both their pale complexion and slight build are the results of a constitution that is weaker than man’s. Elves, therefore, always subtract one point from their initial Constitution ability score. Though they are not as sturdy as humans, elves are much more agile, and they always add one point to their initial Dexterity ability score.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elvish clothing tends to be colorful, but not garish. They often wear pastel colors, especially blues and greens. Because they dwell in forests, however, high elves will often wear greenish-grey cloaks to afford them quick camouflage.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elves have learned that it is very important to understand the creatures—both good and evil—that share their forest home. Because of this, elves may speak the tongue of goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, gnomes, and halflings. in addition to common and their own highly-developed language. They will always show an interest in anything that will allow them to communicate with, and learn from, their forest-dwelling neighbors.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Combat:**</font> Elves are cautious fighters and will always use their strengths to an advantage if possible. One of the greatest strengths elves have is their ability to pass through natural surroundings, such as a wood or forest, silently and almost invisibly. By moving quietly and blending into the vegetation for cover, elves can often surprise a person or party (opponents have a surprise modifier of -5). Also, as long as they are not attacking, the elves hiding in the forest can only be spotted by someone or something with the ability to see invisible objects. The military value of this skill is immense, and elven armies will always send scouts to spy on the enemy, since such spies are rarely caught—or even seen.\\
<wrap indent>Although their constitutions are weak, elves have extremely strong wills. Elves have such strong wills, in fact, that they are 90 % immune to all charm and sleep spells. And even if their natural resistance to these spells fails, they get a normal saving throw—making it unlikely an elf will fall victim to these spells very often.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elves live in the wild, so weapons are used for everything from dealing with the hostile creatures that live around their camps, to such mundane tasks as hunting dinner. The elves’ rigorous training with bows and swords, in addition to their great dexterity, gives them a natural bonus of +1 to hit when fighting with a short or long sword, or using a bow of any kind other than a crossbow. Elves are especially proficient in the use of the bow. Because of their agility, elves can move, fire a bow, then move again, all in the same round, making their archers extremely mobile, and therefore dangerous.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Because of horses' limitations in forest combat, elves do not favor their use. Elves prefer to fight as foot soldiers and are generally armed as such. Most elves wear scale, ring, or chain mail, and almost all high elves carry shields. And although elves have natural bonuses when they use bows and swords, their bands carry a variety of weapons. The composition of a band of elves by weaponry is: spear—30%; sword—20 % ; sword and spear—20%; sword and bow—10%; bow-15%; two-handed sword —5%.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elvish fighters and multi-class fighters have a 10% chance per level to possess a magical item of use to his or her class. This percentage is cumulative and can be applied to each major type of magical item that character could possibly use—for each class in the case of multi-class characters. [For example, a fighter! priest of level 4/5 would have a 40% chance to have a magical item useful to fighters and a 50% chance of having an item useful to priests.) In addition, if above 4th level, elvish mages gain the same percentage chance to gain items, but gain 2-5 magical items useful to them if a successful roll is made.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>For every twenty elves in a group, there will be one 2nd or 3rd level fighter (50% chance of either). For every forty elves in a group, in addition to the group's higher level fighter, there will be a 1st or 2nd level mage (again, 50 % chance of either}. If one hundred or more elves are encountered, the following additional figures will be present: a 4th level fighter/3th level mage; two 4th level fighter/5th level mage; and a 4th level fighter/4th level mage/4th level thief. Finally, if over one hundred and sixty elves are encountered. they will be lead by a 6th level fighter/9th level wage, and a 6th level fighter/6th level mage/6th level thief. These two extremely powerful leaders will have two retainers each—a 4th level fighter/5th level mage. and a 3rd level fighter/3rd level mage/3rd level thief. All of these higher level leaders are added to, not taken from the total number of elves encountered.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elven women are the equal of their male counterparts in all aspects of warfare. In fact, some bands of elves will contain units of female fighters. who will be mounted on unicorns. This occurs rarely (5% chance), and only 10-30 elf maidens will be encountered in such a unit. However, legends of the destruction wrought by these elven women are common among the enemies of the elves.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Habitat/Society:**</font> Elves value their individual freedom highly, so their social structure is based on independent bands. These small groups of no more than two hundred recognize the authority of a royal overlord, who in turn owes allegiance to a king or queen. However, the laws and restraints set upon elven society are very few compared to human society and practically negligible when compared to dwarven society.\\
<wrap indent>Elven camps are always well-hidden and well—protected. In addition to a large number of observation posts and personnel traps set around the camp, high elves typically set 2-12 giant eagles as guardians of their lairs (65% of the time). For every forty elves encountered in a camp, there will be the following high-level elves, as well as the leaders noted above: a 4th level fighter, a 4th level cleric, and a 2nd level fighter/2nd level mage/an level thief. In addition a 4th level fighter/7th level mage, a 5th level fighter, a 6th level fighter, and a 7th level cleric will be present. Females found in a camp will equal 100%, and children will equal 50% of the males encountered.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Because elves remain in the world about 350 years (of their twelve hundred year life span), their view of the world is radically different from most other sentient beings. Their long lifespan means that elves do not place much importance on short-term gains or hurry to finish projects. Humans see this attitude as frivolous; the elves simply find it hard to understand why everyone else is always in such a rush.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Elves prefer to surround themselves with things that can bring them joy for a long period of time—things like music and nature. The company of others of their own race is also very important to elves, as they find it hard to share their experiences or their per spective on the world with other races. This is one of the main reasons elven families are so close. However, even friends of other races are kept forever by an elf, as friendship, too, is something very worthwhile.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Though they are immune to a few specific spells, elves are enthralled by magic for most of their lives. Not a specific spell, of course, but the idea of magic. Cooperation is far more likely purchased from an elf with an obscure, even practically worthless, but interesting magical item, then it is with two sacks of gold.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Ultimately, their radically different perspective separates the elves from the rest of their world. Elves find dwarves far too dour and find their adherence to strict codes of law unpleasant. However, elves do recognize dwarven craftsmanship as something to be lauded. Elves think a bit more highly of humans, though they see man’s race after wealth and fleeting power as rather sad. In the end, all elves leave the world they share with dwarves and men, and journey to a mysterious land where they can live freely for the rest of their many days.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Ecology:**</font> Elves produce fine clothes, beautiful music, and brilliant poems. It is for these that cultures outside of elven society know the folk of the forest best. In their world within the forest, however, elves keep the forces of evil—creatures like orcs that would plunder the forest and then move on—from causing too much damage. For this alone, elves are irreplacable.

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Grey Elves (Faerie)**</font>\\
Unlike high elves, grey elves have either silver hair and amber eyes, or pale golden hair and violet eyes (the latter are known as faerie elves). They favor bright garments of white, gold, silver, or yellow, and wear cloaks of deep blue or purple. The grey elves are the rarest group of elves, and they have little to do with the world outside of their forests. They value intelligence very highly, and, unlike other elves, devote much time to study and contemplation. Their treatises on nature are astounding.\\
<wrap indent>Grey elves value their independence from what they see as the corrupting influence of the outside world, and will fight fiercely to maintain that isolation. All grey elves carry swords, and most wear chain mail and carry a shield. For mounts, grey elves will ride hippogriffs {70%) or griffons [30% l. Those that ride griffons will have 3—12 griffons for guards at their camps instead of giant eagles.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Wood Elves**</font>\\
Also called syluan elves, wood elves are the wild branch of the elf family. Wood elves are slightly darker in complexion than high elves. Their hair is yellow to coppery-red, and their eyes are light brown, light green, or hazel. They wear clothes of dark browns and greens, tans and russets, in order to blend in with their surroundings. Wood elves are very independent and value strength over intelligence. They will avoid contact with strangers 75% of the time.\\
<wrap indent>In battle, wood elves wear studded leather or ring mail, and 50% of their band will be equipped with bows. Only 20% of wood elves carry swords. and only 40% use spears. Wood elves prefer to ambush their enemies, using their ability to hide in the forest until their foes are close at hand. In most cases (70%), wood elf camps are guarded by 2—3 giant owls (80 %) or by 1-6 giant lynx (20% ). These elves speak only elvish and the languages of some forest animals and the treant. Wood elves are more inclined toward the tenets of neutrality rather than good, and are not above killing people who stumble across their camps, in order to keep their location secret.</wrap>

\\
<font inherit/inherit;;#4169E1;;inherit>**Half-Elves**</font>\\
Half-elves are always of human stock, and have features of both the elven and human parent. They are slightly taller than the common elf, growing as tall as 512’; feet and weighing up to 150 pounds. Though they do not gain the natural sword or bow bonus from their elven relatives, they do have normal infravision.\\
<wrap indent>A half-elf can travel freely between most elvish and human settlements, though occasionally prejudice will be a problem. The half~elf's lifespan is the biggst source of grief, however. As a half-elf lives more than 125 years, he or she will outlive any human friends or relatives, but grow old too quickly to be a real part of elven society. Many half—elves deal with this by traveling frequently between the two societies, enjoying life as it comes and taking the best of both worlds. Half-elves may spealt common, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll.</wrap>
