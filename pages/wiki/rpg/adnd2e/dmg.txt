<WRAP centeralign><fc #ff0000><fs xx-large>Foreword to the 2nd Edition</fs></fc></WRAP>
<wrap indent>A foreword is normally the place where the author of a book expresses thanks and
gratitude. I'm not going to do that here. It's not that everyone involved doesn't deserve
congratulations and praise, it's just that I already said all those things in the foreword to
the AD&D //Player's Handbook//. Everything I said there is true for this book, too. On to
other things.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Let's assume that since you're reading this, your are, or plan to be, a Dungeon Master.
By now, you should be familiar with the rules in the //Player's Handbook//. You've probably
already noticed things you like or things you would have done differently. If you have,
congratulations. You've got the spirit every Dungeon Master needs. As you go through
this rule book, I encourage you to continue to make these choices.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Choice is what the AD&D game is all about. We've tried to offer you what we think
are the best choices for your AD&D campaign, but each of us has different likes and
dislikes. The game that I enjoy may be quite different from your own campaign. But it is
not for me to say what is right or wrong for your game. True, I and everyone working on
the AD&D game have had to make fundamental decisions, but we've tried to avoid being
dogmatic and inflexible. The AD&D game is yours, it's mine, it's every player's game.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>So is there an "official" AD&D game? Yes, but only when there needs to be. Although
I don't have a crystal ball, it's likely that tournaments and other official events will use all
of the core rules in these books. Optional rules may or may not be used, but it's fair to say
that all players need to know about them even if they don't have the memorized.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master Guide give you what you're expected
to know, but that doesn't mean the game begins and ends there. Your game will go in
directions not yet explored and your players will try things others think strange.
Sometimes these strange things will work; sometimes they won't. Just accept this, be
ready for it, and enjoy it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Take the time to have fun with the AD&D rules. Add, create, expand, and extrapolate.
Don't just let the game sit there, and don't become a rules lawyer worrying about each
piddly little detail. If you can't figure out the answer, MAKE IT UP! And whatever you
do, don't fall into the trap of believing these rules are complete. They are not. You cannot
sit back and let the rule book do everything for you. Take the time and effort to become
not just a good DM, but a brilliant one.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>At conventions, in letters, and over the phone I'm often asked for the instant answer to
a fine point of the game rules. More often than not, I come back with a question—what
do you feel is right? And the people asking the questions discover that not only can they
create an answer, but that their answer is as good as anyone else's. The rules are only
guidelines.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>At the beginning of the first Dungeon Master Guide, Gary Gygax stressed that each of
us, working from a common base, would make the AD&D game grow in a variety of
different directions. That is more true today than ever. Don't be afraid of experimentation,
but do be careful. As a Dungeon Master, you have great power, and "with great power
comes great responsibility." Use it wisely.</wrap>\\

One of the toughest challenges facing a DM (and I can only assume that everyone
reading this either is, or wants to be, a DM) is keeping his game sessions fresh and
exciting.\\
<wrap indent>Those of us who produce new material for the AD&D game as a whole have a more or
less similar task, although on a larger scale. We are constantly searching for ways to
make adventures and game accessories unique, or at least original and distinctive. Like
Sir Isaac Newton, we've learned from experience that when faced with multiple choices,
the simplest alternative is often the best.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Hence the book you hold in your hands.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>After six years, it was time for the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master Guide, the
two most important AD&D rule books, to get freshened up. What could be better and
simpler than a new coat of paint? Products that we publish today don't look like products
we published in 1989, or even in 1993. We haven't changed the game in any substantial
way (aside from the usual clarifications and corrections that go along with any reprint).
But we have let these books catch up to our new standards. They're larger, more colorful,
and more readable, all with an eye toward making your DMing job easier.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Bringing this project together rekindled a lot of memories. In particular, one day from
1987 stands out in my mind. I remember it vividly because it was the day when Dave
Cook and I drew up the very first outline and schedule for the 2nd Edition of the
Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. What needed to be done, and how it should be
done, looked clear and simple on our neat, four-page report. In fact, that massive
undertaking occupied almost two years of our lives, and I've spent most of my time since
then caring for the AD&D game.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>That's a job that we enjoy, or we wouldn't be doing it. Most of us feel that we have a
stake, to one extent or another, in every AD&D campaign out there. When you and your
players get together, the months (often years) of designing, discussing, playtesting,
redesigning, arguing, editing, sketching, and head scratching disappear into the
background. But no matter whether you play by the books or with a binder full of home
rules, we're all in this together, united by the common thread of the AD&D game.</wrap>\\
