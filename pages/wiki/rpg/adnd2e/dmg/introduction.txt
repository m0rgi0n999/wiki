**<fc #ff0000><fs xx-large>Introduction</fs></fc>**\\
You are one of a very special group of people: AD&D® game Dungeon Masters. Your
job is not an easy one. It requires wit, imagination, and the ability to think and act
extemporaneously. A really good Dungeon Master is essential to a good game.\\
<wrap indent>The //Dungeon Master Guide// is reserved for Dungeon Masters. Discourage players from
reading this book, and certainly don't let players consult it during the game. As long as
the players don't know exactly what's in the //Dungeon Master Guide//, they'll always
wonder what you know that they don't. It doesn't matter whether you have secret
information; even if you don't, as long as the players think you do, their sense of mystery
and uncertainty is maintained.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Also, this book contains essential rules that are not discussed in the //Player's
Handbook//. Some of these rules the players will learn quickly during play—special
combat situations, the costs of hiring NPCs, etc. Others, however, cover more esoteric or
mysterious situations, such as the nature of artifacts and other magical items. This
information is in the //Dungeon Master Guide// so the DM can control the players' (and
hence the characters') access to certain bits of knowledge. In a fantasy world, as in this
world, information is power. What the characters don't know //can// hurt them (or lead them
on a merry chase to nowhere). While the players aren't your enemies, they aren't your
allies, either, and you aren't obligated to give anything away for nothing. If characters go
hunting wererats without doing any research beforehand, feel free to throw lots of curves
their way. Reward those characters who take the time to do some checking.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Besides rules, you'll find a large portion of this book devoted to discussions of the
principles behind the rules. Along with this are examinations of the pros and cons of
changing the rules to fit your campaign. The purpose of this book, after all, is to better
prepare you for your role as game moderator and referee. The better you understand the
game, the better equipped you'll be to handle unforeseen developments and unusual
circumstances.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>One of the principles guiding this project from the very beginning, and which is
expressed throughout this book, is this: The DM has the primary responsibility for the
success of his campaign, and he must take an active hand in guiding it. That is an
important concept. If you are skimming through this introduction, slow down and read it
again. It is crucial you understand what you are getting into.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The DM's "active hand" extends even to the rules. Many decisions about your
campaign can be made by only one person: you. Tailor your campaign to fit your own
style and the style of your players.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You will find a lot of information in this book, but you won't find pat answers to all
your questions and easy solutions for all your game problems. What you will find instead
is a discussion of various problems and numerous triggers intended to guide you through
a thoughtful analysis of situations that pertain to your campaign.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The rules to the AD&D 2nd Edition game are balanced and easy to use. No roleplaying
game we know of has been playtested more heavily than this one. But that
doesn't mean it's perfect. What we consider to be right may be unbalanced or
anachronistic in your campaign. The only thing that can make the AD&D game "right''
for all players is the intelligent application of DM discretion.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A perfect example of this is the limit placed on experience levels for demihumans. A
lot of people complained that these limits were too low. We agreed, and we raised the
limits. The new limits were tested, examined, and adjusted until we decided they were
right. But you may be one of the few people who prefer the older, lower limits. Or you
may think there should be no limits. In the chapter on character classes, you'll find a
discussion of this topic that considers the pros and cons of level limits. We don't ask you
to blindly accept every limit we've established. But we do ask that before you make any
changes you read this chapter and carefully consider what you are about to do. If, after
weighing the evidence, you decide that a change is justified in your game, by all means
make the change.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>In short, follow the rules as they are written if doing so improves your game. But by
the same token, break the rules only if doing so improves your game.</wrap>\\

**<fc #800080><fs x-large>A Word About Organization</fs></fc>**\\
Everything in this book is based on the assumption that you are familiar with the
Player's Handbook. To make your job easier, the //Player's Handbook// and //Dungeon
Master Guide// have parallel organization. Chapters appear in the same order in both
books. That means if you know where to find something in the //Player's Handbook//, you
also know where to find it in this book.\\
<wrap indent>Also, the index in this book also covers both the //Player's Handbook//. You can find all
the references to any specific topic by checking this index.</wrap>\\

**<fc #800080><fs x-large>The Fine Art of Being a DM</fs></fc>**\\
Being a good Dungeon Master involves a lot more than knowing the rules. It calls for
quick wit, theatrical flair, and a good sense of dramatic timing—among other things.
Most of us can claim these attributes to some degree, but there's always room for
improvement.\\
<wrap indent>Fortunately, skills like these can be learned and improved with practice. There are
hundreds of tricks, shortcuts, and simple principles that can make you a better, more
dramatic, and more creative game master.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>But you won't find them in the Dungeon Master Guide. This is a reference book for
running the AD&D game. We tried to minimize material that doesn't pertain to the
immediate conduct of the game. If you are interested in reading more about this aspect of
refereeing, we refer you to Dragon® Magazine, published monthly by TSR, Inc. Dragon
Magazine is devoted to role-playing in general and the AD&D game in particular. For
more than 16 years, Dragon Magazine has published articles on every facet of roleplaying.
It is invaluable for DMs and players.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If you have never played a role-playing game before but are eager to learn, our advice
from the Player's Handbook is still the best: Find a group of people who already play the
game and join them for a few sessions. If that is impractical, the best alternative is to get
a copy of the Introduction to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Game. It covers all the
basics of fantasy role-playing with the AD&D game, but in a much simpler presentation
which teaches as you play. It includes several introductory role-playing adventures.
These will show you what goes on during the game and give you step-by-step
instructions on how to set up and run a game with your friends.</wrap>
