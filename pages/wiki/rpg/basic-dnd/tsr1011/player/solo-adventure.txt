<WRAP col3 justify>
In the following one-player adventure, you will explore a dungeon, looking for monsters and treasures. **Part 1** is a shopping trip in town. In **Part 2**, you will learn more about battles. And in **Part 3** you will visit the dungeon. You will often be given choices, and asked to pick one. Each choice gives a.number; turn to that number to find the results of your choice. Your adventure will continue from there.

===== Part 1: Town Business =====
You spend a few days in town, letting your wounds heal. Since you found so much treasure on your first adventure, you go shopping for some better armor.\\
<wrap indent>Armorer Baldwick knows you well. He’s a jolly fellow, getting a bit gray. You remember snitching apples from the big tree in his yard when you were young and foolish.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Well, well!” he booms, as you enter his shop. “How have YOU been these days? All grown up now, I see!”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You chat for a few minutes about your younger days, and then you ask if he has any armor that would fit you.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Why, surely! Let me see, let me see . . .” He pushes his way through racks of armor of all kinds, as you follow closely behind. There are dozens of sets of armor, for people of all sizes, but most of them need repair.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“AHA!” he exclaims, pulling an armload of metal down. “Try this on!” The armor you are wearing is made of round chain links, all skillfully interwoven to form a covering for most of your body. But this armor is different. Large pieces of well-crafted metal are fastened to chain mail and leather, fashioned into pieces that you could wear.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Plate mail, of course; just finished it a week or two ago. Want to try it on? I think it’ll fit.”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You go to a back room and remove your chain mail, and try this heavier armor on for size. Sure enough, it fits, almost as if it were made just for you. The metal plates hang from leather straps and chain mail links, forming a tough protective suit. But it’s very heavy, almost twice as heavy as your chain mail.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You come out to show him, and he walks around you, carrying a piece of charcoal and marking the armor here and there for some necessary adjustments. “Looks good!” he exclaims. “Just a bit here, and a bit there. . . want to trade in that chain mail you had on? Looked to be in pretty good shape . . . .”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Wait a minute!” you reply. “Don’t you have anything lighter than this stuff? I’m not going to be able to carry as much treasure if I wear all this metal!”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Ah, well!” he says, soothingly. “If you want better protection, you have to use this. Unless, of course, you can somehow find magical armor.”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Plate mail will improve your Armor Class to AC 2, better than your current AC 4, so it would be nice to have.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Well, how much?” you ask.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Well. . . 75 gold pieces as is. Want to trade in that chain mail?” he repeats.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Oh, I guess so,” you reply. “How much?”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“For you, well . . . since you’re trying to get started, and since I’ve known you so long . . . 50 gold pieces, with your trade-in.”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You talk with him a bit more, using your Charisma, and bargain him down to a better price.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Okay, OKAY!” he says finally. “Just 30 gold pieces with the trade-in, and you promise to come here first the next time you need better armor or more weapons. Agreed!” He stomps off, grumbling, then stops and turns. “You can pick it up Tuesday. Pay the clerk on your way out!”</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Subtract 30 gold pieces worth of coins from the Money on your character sheet. You can either subtract it from your gp, or use some coins of lesser value if you understand the Conversion Table. Change the numbers on your sheet to account for your spending, and change your Equipment List. Then turn the sheet over, and change your Armor Class to 2.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You come back to the shop in a few days and pick up your heavy Plate Mail (it’s not ready on Tuesday, but you have time to wait). You spend the time looking around for other adventurers -- any help would be welcome - but the few you find all just want to relax, have a good time, and heal up from their last adventures.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>So, fully equipped but still alone, you set off one morning for the caves near town, remembering to watch out for ghouls.</wrap>\\

===== Part 2: Battles =====
You are almost ready to enter the “dungeon.” But first, you need to learn a little more about battles.\\
<wrap indent>You already know how to swing at a monster:</wrap>\\
<html><hr class="style6" /></html>
You roll 1d20 (a twenty-sided die), and compare the result to the Hit roll given in the description. If you rolled that number or higher, you hit the enemy, and roll Damage.
<html><hr class="style6" /></html>

=== More Damage! ===
In your first adventure, each time you hit a monster you.did 1 point of damage. However, from now on, you will roll 1d6 (a six-sided die) to see how much damage you do to the creature you are fighting.\\
<wrap indent>You will keep track of the damage in the same way, writing down the starting number and subtracting the damage each time you hit. Just cross off the old number of hit points, and write down the new number.</wrap>\\

=== The Monsters ===
Monsters will also be able to do more damage. In your one-player games, you will keep track of their damage on a separate sheet of paper along with your own. In group games, the Dungeon Master keeps track of all the monster details.\\
<wrap indent>Some monsters do 1-6 points of damage, just as you do. But sometimes they do more or less than ld6. Each time you encounter a monster, the information you need will be given in a box, like this:</wrap>\\
<html><hr class="style6" /></html>
<WRAP centeralign>
<box>
|  GOBLIN: 17 | D: 1d6  |
|  You: 12 | hp: 4  |
</box>
</WRAP>
<html><hr class="style6" /></html>
The number after the monster’s name is the roll it needs to hit your fighter. “D” is the dice to roll after the monster hits, to find the amount of damage .it did to you. The monster’s hit points are also given.\\
<wrap indent>In this example, if you roll a 12 or higher, you hit the goblin. You then roll 1d6, the standard amount, and add 2 (for your Strength bonus). You subtract that total from the goblin’s 4 hp (as given above). If the goblin’s new total is zero or less, the creature is dead. If the goblin still has any hit points left, it swings at you:</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If you roll a 17 or higher for the goblin’s attack, he hits you, for 1-6 points of damage as noted in the box above. You roll the six-sided die and subtract the result from your 8 hit points.</wrap>\\

=== Combat Checklist ===
A step-by-step list of everything you need to do when fighting a monster is given on the same page as the monster description (the boxed information). Use this checklist for every battle, to be sure you are running each one correctly.\\

=== Record Keeping ===
Use a piece of scrap paper to keep track of the battles. Whenever you find some treasure, write down the amount and type on the same paper. Experience points will be given at the end of the adventure, but you will need a list of the creatures your fighter conquers. All the points for treasure and experience will be added up at the end of the adventure.\\

=== Getting Killed ===
If your character is slain by the monsters, that is the end of the adventure. But it’s not the end of the game! You can start the fighter over again, pretending that it is a new character.\\
<wrap indent>If you play this adventure a second time, do not keep any treasure found before you “got killed!” You should start the character over again, from the beginning.</wrap>\\
<html><hr class="style6" /></html>
Remember that you are carrying a magical Potion of Healing. If you get hurt, you can drink it, and it will cure all your damage. You can then change your hit points back to 8. You can only drink it once, and then it’s gone.\\
<wrap indent>You may drink the potion whenever you wish, but you should wait until you have only 2 or 3 hit points left, if possible. If you drink it in the middle of a battle, you must skip your attack (you are drinking, not swinging), and roll only for the monster’s attack for that round of combat.</wrap>\\
<html><hr class="style6" /></html>

<html><hr class="style5" /></html>
<WRAP centeralign>**THINGS TO REMEMBER**</WRAP>
<html><hr class="style1" /></html>
1. Keep a record of the monsters killed and treasure found, using a separate piece of paper.\\
2. Use the Combat Checklist whenever you have a battle.\\
3. Roll 1d6 each time you hit, to find the amount of damage done.\\
4. Drink your potion when you are badly hurt.\\
<html><hr class="style5" /></html>

=== Mapping ===
This time, you will make a map of the dungeon so you don’t get lost. Maps also help in remembering where the worst monsters were -- like the ghouls -- so you can avoid them until you feel ready for them.\\
<wrap indent>You will draw your map on a piece of graph paper. Each line one square long will equal 10 feet in the dungeon. Copy each map carefully. Draw an arrow pointing to the top of the paper and label it “North”, then draw a line across the arrow and label “East, South, and West.” This will help you remember the directions.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As you draw your maps be sure to write notes on it to help you remind you where things are.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If you don’t make a map as you go, you will probably get confused.</wrap>\\
<html><hr class="style2" /></html>

===== Part 3: Into The Caves =====

Since you explored some of the caves earlier, you find yet another entrance to venture into this time. After finding a suitable cave, you pause to be sure you are ready.\\
<wrap indent>The caves are dark and dreary, as you remember from the last time, so you get out your lantern and light the wick, using your tinderbox. Then, carefully, you step into the first "room."</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Tear the sheet of graph paper out of the center of this booklet. Then, starting near the bottom, copy **Entry 1 Map:**</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**1**</fs> The room you are in is fifty feetsquare, with 10’ wide exits in the middle of the north, south, east, and west walls. The ceiling of the room is 15’ up, but the corridors are only 10’ tall.\\
<wrap indent>The walls, floor, and ceiling are made of rough rock. There are some cracks and crevices in the rock walls, all very small. Standing in the exact center of the room is a stone statue of a woman in armor. You examine it carefully, and finally even touch it - but it is merely a statue, nothing magical or special.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>You have entered this 50’ square room by the southern corridor, which leads out to fresh air and sunlight. The other corridors are dark. The light from your lamp helps, but shadows linger in the corners of this large room. Do you want to:</wrap>\\

| Stop and Listen?  |  Read 42 |
| Search the Room?  |  Read 57 |
| Go down a corridor?  |  Read 58 |

<fs x-large>**2**</fs> You are back outside! If you want to go back inside, read #1. If you want to quit, stop reading here; your fighter goes back to town. If you killed any monsters or found any treasure, read 88 to find how many Experience Points you have earned. If you want to go shopping for supplies, read 89.

<fs x-large>**3**</fs> You go south, and leave the caves. You may go home, and end this adventure, or you can go back to the first room. Read 2 for further instructions.

<fs x-large>**4**</fs> You go south from the strange room. If you have already killed the monsters and taken the treasure from this part of the dungeon, read 23. If not, read 44.

<fs x-large>**5**</fs> You decide to go back to the statue room. Return to 1.

<fs x-large>**6**</fs> You go back to the statue room. Read 58.

<fs x-large>**7**</fs> You turn the corner and follow the passage back to a room. Read 9.

<fs x-large>**8**</fs> After the turn, the corridor goes 50‘ west and opens into a room. Read 54 after you add **Entry 8 Map**  to yours:

<fs x-large>**9**</fs> You may go one of three ways. Do you want to:\\

| Go North?  |  Read 21 |
| Go East?  |  Read 53 |
| Go back to the statue room?  |  Read 36 |

<fs x-large>**10**</fs> If you have already killed the monsters and taken the treasure from this part of the dungeon, read 9. If not, continue:
<wrap indent>The corridor goes 20’ north from the room and then turns right. You peek around the corner, and see that the corridor goes 20’ and opens into another room. Read 54.</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**11**</fs> You quietly approach the room, and you don’t see anything unusual. But as you step into the room, some giant rats leap out from the corner to your right, and attack! Two of them hit you, for a total of 3 points of damage. You are suddenly in battle, and cannot escape. Read 83.\\

<fs x-large>**12**</fs> Talking to the creature doesn’t do any good. It attacks, and gets one free swing while you are talking! Read 86, and run the battle normally after giving the monster one free attack.

<fs x-large>**13**</fs> You kill the two skeletons! As each one "dies," its bones collapse in a heap, and the rusty sword drops to the floor with a clang.\\
<wrap indent>You search the area, but find no treasure. However, there is a door in the east wall of the room. Do you want to:</wrap>\\

| Go South?  |  Read 62 |
| Open the door?  |  Read 27 |

<fs x-large>**14**</fs> You go west, and come to another room. It has an exit south, leading outside, and another corridor heading west. You don’t want to go west, the ghouls are in that direction.
<wrap indent>You recognize this room as the entrance for your very first adventure! This is where you hit the goblin, and he ran away. Do you want to:</wrap>\\

| Go back East?  |  Read 62 |

<fs x-large>**15**</fs> If you have already killed all the monsters in this part of the dungeon, read 61. If not, continue:\\
<wrap indent>The corridor goes north and opens into a room. The area looks like **Entry 15 Map**  (add it to your map):</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As you peer into the room, you see two skeletons with rusty swords standing about 10’ from you, around the corner. Without making a sound, they step forward, grinning horribly, and swing at you. One of them hits, for 2 points of damage. Read 26.</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**18**</fs> You carefully enter the room, and see two goblins in a far corner. They have swords, and seem to be expecting you. They attack, and each gets a free swing before you can react. Read 85 and run the battle normally, but give each goblin one free swing to start.

<fs x-large>**19**</fs> You think that there are goblins up here, so you keep your lantern shuttered and sneak up to peek into the room. You hear soft talking in a language you don’t understand.\\
<wrap indent>Peeking around the corner, you see two goblins to your right, at the south end of the room. They seem to be talking about something and don’t notice you. Do you want to:</wrap>\\

<wrap indent>You search the room, listening and looking carefully, but you find nothing. Suddenly, as you are about to leave, the lips of the giant mouth move, and in a big booming bass voice it says, "Surprise! You are here for double-or-nothing! Ready or not, here we go. O-T-T-F-F-S-S.

<fs x-large>**60**</fs> Your armor, shield, sword, and dagger have all been turned to rust by the fearsome Rust Monster! But now that you have no more metal, the creature turns away from you, not interested any more. You can see, now, that it has no teeth or claws, and can’t actually hurt you!\\
<wrap indent>You watch as it ambles over to one of the piles of rust, and it starts to eat, ignoring you completely.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Keeping a careful eye on the creature, you look around the room. There are gems here and there, some covered by rust; you collect six of them! Their total value is 300 gp.</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**63**</fs> You leap out and attack the goblins! You will get two free swings before they can get their swords out. Read 85, and run the battle normally after taking your 2 free attacks.\\

<fs x-large>**64**</fs> You attack the goblin. Your first swing misses, and the goblin misses you. But you see, coming from the north corridor, two more goblins, waving swords and looking very angry. Do you want to:\\

<wrap indent>You must eventually go back, so read 37.</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**67**</fs> Since you didn’t kill the Rust Monster, it’s still there, eating rust. Are you dragging a large chest full of coins?\\

<fs x-large>**72**</fs> You turn to run and a skeleton hits you again for 1 more point of damage. If you are still alive, you run south to a corridor, where you can turn east or west. Looking back, you see that the skeletons are not following you. You stop and catch your breath. Read 62\\

<fs x-large>**73**</fs> You decide to flee. As you turn to run, you are hit by one goblin’s sword for 2 points of damage. (If your hit points reach zero, you are dead unless you can drink the potion; otherwise, continue.) You run back into the first room, and continue through it and out the south passage, toward sunlight.\\
<wrap indent>A group of goblins is running after you, shouting and waving their swords. They stop at the cave entrance, and keep screaming and waving their swords; but there are too many of them. You decide to go home.</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**80**</fs> You put the key in the lock and turn until you hear it "click." Putting the key away you open the door.\\
<wrap indent>There is a small room behind the door! The area looks like **Entry 80A Map**  (add it to your map):</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The room is empty except for one large chest by one wall. You walk over to it, and discover that it’s made of heavy wood with metal bands around it. It isn’t locked (luckily), so you carefully open it. But alas - it’s trapped. Make a saving throw vs. Magic Wands! (You need to roll a 13 or higher on 1d20.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This Saving Throw is used for many things. Generally, it indicates whether you jump out of the path of danger — such as the beam of a magic wand. However, in this case, the danger is a blade, mounted on the edge of the chest and connected to a metal spring. When you open the lid, the blade sweeps out toward you.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If you made the Saving Throw, you jump back as the blade misses you. However, if you missed the Saving Throw, you take 4 points of damage!</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If you are struck down to zero hit points or less, you can grab your potion — if you still have it - and drink it before you pass out. It will cure you somewhat, but only back up to 4 hit points. If you don’t have the potion left — sorry, but you are dead! (//Special note://  In group games, you will //not//  be allowed to do this. Zero hit points indicates death, with no extra time to do anything.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If the trap kills you, read 90. But if you survived the trap, continue reading.</wrap>\\

<WRAP centeralign>**Entry 80A map**</WRAP>

<wrap indent>You look in the chest and see hundreds of coins - 500 cp, 200 sp, and 200 ep. You start to close the chest and drag it out with you. But as you close the lid, you see a peep hole in the north wall, about an inch across. It was blocked by the door as you entered. File: You look through, and see a short corridor that goes north 20‘ and turns left. To the east, by the turn, is a large door with two stout bars across it. A goblin is standing by the door, apparently on guard. The area looks like **Entry 80B Map**.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>There is a crack in the wall near this peep hole. You suddenly realize that the crack might be the edge of a secret door! This treasure chest must belong to goblins! However, you can’t open the secret door, so you drag the chest back out, past the scattered bones of the dead skeletons and south to the main corridor. Read 62.</wrap>\\

<fs x-large>**81**</fs> Oops! As you enter the room, the Rust Monster looks up from its feeding, grunts, and runs toward you. It rushes to the chest you are dragging, and before you can escape, it dissolves the metal bands around the chest. The chest comes apart, coins falling everywhere, and the creature gleefully turns all the coins to rust! Do you want to:\\

<wrap indent>If you have been here before, you might not have some of the items mentioned below. Resume the battle wherever you left off, and remember to keep track of the equipment you have left.</wrap>\\

**First Hit:** Your shield turns to rust and falls apart. Now the Rust Monster only needs an 11 or better to hit you. Read the "Special Note" below.\\
**Second Hit:** Your Armor turns to rust. Now the creature only needs a roll of 6 or higher to hit.\\
**Third Hit:** Your sword turns to rust! You must get out a dagger if you want to continue the fight.\\
**Fourth Hit:** Your dagger turns to rust! You have no more weapons. Read 60.\\
//Special Note:// When you lose your armor or shield, you become easier to hit. All monsters you encounter afterward will gain bonuses to their Hit Rolls. If you lose your shield, give them a **+1** bonus. If you lose your armor, give them a total bonus of **+7** to their Hit Rolls.\\

<fs x-large>**88**</fs> When you complete this adventure, you get Experience Points. First, add up all the treasure you brought out of the dungeon (ignore anything you lost), and figure out how much it is all worth, in gold pieces. (The explanation of the Money system is on page 10.) You will get 1 XP for each 1 gp worth of treasure you find — in addition to getting the treasure.\\
<wrap indent>After adding up the treasure, find out how much Experience you get for slaying monsters, according to this chart:</wrap>\\

|Giant Rats  |5  |each|
|Goblins  |5  |each|
|Skeletons  |10|each|
|Rust Monster|300|   |

<wrap indent>Add that total to your treasure total to get the total number of Experience Points awarded for this adventure. To determine your + 10% bonus, drop the last number, and add it to the total awarded. Then add the adjusted total XP earned to the current XP on the back of your character sheet, to find your new total overall. To finish up, add the treasure you found to the money you already had.</wrap>\\
<box 80% #A5A5A5>EXAMPLE: Imagine  that you killed the Rust Monster and found 6 gems there, with a value of 600 gp. You also killed 3 giant rats, finding 100 cp and 100 sp. Imagine that you have no other notes.</box>
<wrap indent>Looking on the conversion chart, you see that 100 cp = 1 gp; 100 sp = 10 gp. Adding that to the gem value, your newly found treasure is worth a total of 611 gp.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>For monsters, you get 300 XP for the rust monster, plus 15 XP for the giant rats (5 each). That total is 315. Adding it to the 611 for treasure, your total XP award is 926.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>To find your 10% bonus, drop the 6. Add the bonus of 92 to the award of 926, for an adjusted total XP of 1018. Then you add that to your current 523 XP, for a new total XP of 1541 — less than 500 XP from 2nd Level! Lastly, you add the actual treasure — 6 gems (worth 600 gp), 100 cp, and 100 sp — to your treasure list.</wrap>\\

That finishes this adventure. You may go to the next adventure, or you may wish to go shopping. If you want to buy something now, read 89.\\

<html><hr class="style2" /></html>

<fs x-large>**89**</fs> You want to go shopping. Instead of making an adventure out of it (like the beginning of this trip), you may simply imagine that you are visiting the various shops in town, buying whatever you need. The items you may buy — armor, weapons, and other equipment — are listed below, along with their prices.\\
<wrap indent>To make a shopping trip, first write down the items you want, and their prices, on a piece of scrap paper. Then add up the total cost. If you can afford what you want, subtract that total cost from your treasure. Write the items in the "Normal Items" section on the back of the Character Sheet. Be sure to write the new total treasure in the Money box.</wrap>\\

<wrap indent>You may start over, if you wish. To do that, be sure not to keep any treasure you may have found before you died.
